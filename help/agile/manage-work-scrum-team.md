# Manage work as a Scrum team

Now that you’ve created your Creative Marketing scrum team, step into the shoes of the scrum master to see what their experience is like. 

As the scrum master, your goal is to determine what your team needs to work on first. You’ll organize the stories in the backlog according to the priority of the product owner. If the team has received any team requests from projects or request queues, those will already show up in the backlog. However, you may also need to add stories that don’t specifically belong on a project already in Adobe Workfront.

The Agile team will groom the backlog together. This basically means three things will happen. 

- First, the scrum master will help the team understand what the product owner’s expectations are for what work should be getting done. 
- Second, team members will estimate how long it will take to complete each story. 
- Third, the team uses this information to make informed decisions about what to work on, and when to work on it.
