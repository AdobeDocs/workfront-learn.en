# Report on issues

The video provides a step-by-step guide on creating two types of reports to manage and track issues and projects. ​

* **Issue Report:** This report helps track whether an issue has been assigned or converted into a task or project (resolving object). ​ It includes columns like resolving object and entry date, sorted by the most recent entries. Filters are applied to show only issues from specific request queues that are not yet complete. ​
* **Project Report:** This report focuses on projects that originated from issues, showing details about the original issues and the progress of the projects. ​ It includes columns like converted issue entry date, issue name, originator name, project status, and progress status. Filters ensure only projects converted from issues and not yet complete are displayed. ​

The video emphasizes customizing columns and filters to tailor the reports to specific needs, making it easier to manage and resolve issues efficiently. ​
