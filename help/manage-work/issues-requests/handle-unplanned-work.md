# Handle unplanned work

## Introduction to issues in Workfront

Your project is live and moving along. All of a sudden, something happens that could affect the work—maybe it’s something small that delays a single task, or maybe it’s something bigger, with the potential to affect the overall project timeline.

How do you log and manage the problems, obstacles, or unplanned work items that arise? [!DNL Workfront] refers to these as 'issues'.

In order for the problem to be resolved, you should start by documenting the problem—in other words, log an issue.

## Logging issues

Unplanned events can affect the project as a whole or only an individual task. If not resolved, these issues may be detrimental to the progress of the project.

Issues can be added at the project level or the task level in [!DNL Workfront].

* A project-level issue is something that could affect the project as a whole or possibly disrupt the project timeline. It could also be something the project manager specifically needs to handle.
* A task-level issue is tied to the work being done to complete a specific task. In this case, the work on the task could be hindered until the issue has been taken care of.

Once you decide where the issue should be logged, the steps are the same:

1. Open the task or project you want to log the issue on.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Issues]** section in the left panel.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL New Issue]** button.
1. Enter a name for the issue, a description, and other fields required by your organization. (Fields with bold names are required, and the issue cannot be saved until those are filled out.)
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save New Issue]**.

The issue now appears in the [!UICONTROL Issues] section of your task or project. You can use [!DNL Workfront’s] in-line editing features to update or add information to the issue.

If you prefer, you can use the [!UICONTROL Add More Issues] link at the bottom of the list, then use the in-line editing to fill in the fields visible on the page. To enter additional information, check the box next to the issue and then click the edit icon (the pencil) to open the details window.

All issues logged on tasks “roll up” to the project level and can be accessed from the [!UICONTROL Issues] tab on the project landing page. This provides an efficient way for project managers to review, assign, and update issues associated with a project or tasks in the project.

By logging the issue, you’re making sure that not only does the problem get resolved, you’re giving your organization the information it needs to report on the problems that arise during projects. Ultimately, this information can help improve project planning and anticipate problems.

## Make an update, log an issue, or create a task?

Your organization should establish guidelines or a workflow process for logging issues in [!DNL Workfront]. With everyone following the same process and logging problems the same way, issues won’t get overlooked.

[!DNL Workfront] offers these basic recommendations for how to handle unplanned work:

* **Update**—Project team members may handle simple requests, such as requesting for a few hours of help or asking a quick question, through a comment in the Updates section.
* **Issue**—When roadblocks arise or something needs to be tracked as a work item, it should be logged as an issue.
* **Task**—If fixing the problem is determined to be planned work, use a task so you can schedule the work in the project timeline. Issues cannot be added to a project timeline.

Before you start adding tasks to your project, keep in mind that you can convert an issue into a task and add that to your project. <!-- Learn how to do this in Section 3 of this learning path. -->
