## Key takeaways

* **Finding Requests in Workfront Home:** Users can view requests assigned to them or those awaiting their approval, depending on their role. ​
* **Using Filters in the Request Area:** Filters like "my requests" and "my open requests" allow users to see requests they created. ​
* **Managing Requests on the Teams Page:** Users can see unassigned team requests and assign them to themselves or others, using the workload balancer to manage team member assignments based on their current workload. ​
* **Custom Reports and Dashboards:** Users can create custom reports to track requests, allowing for personalized naming, filters, views, and groupings, which helps in managing and prioritizing requests effectively. ​
* **Understanding "My" in Filters:** The term "my" in Home refers to issues assigned to me. The term "my" in the Request Area, refers to issues requested by me. ​
