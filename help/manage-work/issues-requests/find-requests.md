# Find and manage requests

This video explains how to find and manage requests in Workfront. ​ It covers four main areas:

* **Workfront Home:** Users like Mary Smith, a production artist, can see requests assigned to them. ​ Joan Harris, who often makes requests, can find completed requests awaiting her approval. ​
* **Request Area:** Users can filter requests to see those they created.​ The term "my" in the request area refers to issues created by me, the logged-in user. ​
* **Teams Page:** Users can view unassigned team requests and assign themselves or others. ​ They can also use the workload balancer to manage team assignments based on current workloads. ​
* **Custom Reports and Dashboards:** Users can create custom reports to track requests, with control over naming, filters, views, and groupings. ​ This allows for clear tracking of requests by priority, creator, primary contact, assignee, and status. ​
