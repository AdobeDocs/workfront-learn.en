## Key takeaways

* **Conversion Process:** To convert an issue or request into a project, select the issue, use the three-dot menu, and choose a conversion option, preferably using a template. ​
* **Template Selection:** Using a template is recommended for consistency and ease. ​ You can review and select the appropriate template based on the project requirements. ​
* **Project Details:** The project name and description are copied from the issue by default but can be edited. ​ Custom forms from the issue are also carried over to the project. ​
* **Issue Resolution:** You can choose to keep the original issue tied to the project, preventing it from being marked as resolved until the project is completed. ​ Alternatively, the issue can be deleted upon conversion. ​
* **Access and Visibility:** You can grant access to the project to the requester. ​ The converted project will be visible in the "converted to" column, indicating whether it was converted to a task or project. ​
