# Make a request

The video provides a detailed guide on how to make and manage requests within Workfront. It explains the process of creating a request, starting by selecting "Requests" from the main menu and clicking the "New Request" button. ​ Users can choose a request type from custom-designed queues tailored to their organization's workflows.

## Key takeaways

* **Streamlined Request Creation:** Users can easily create requests by selecting "Requests" from the main menu, choosing a request type, filling out required fields, and attaching relevant documents. ​
* **Customizable Workflows:** Request queues and forms are tailored to organizational workflows, allowing users to specify details (e.g., in-store, outdoor, social media) and priority.
* **Draft Autosave Feature:** Drafts are automatically saved as users fill out the subject field, ensuring no data is lost if they pause or navigate away. ​ Drafts can be accessed later for completion or discarded if unnecessary. ​
* **Tracking and Filtering Requests:** Submitted requests can be tracked on the "Submitted" page, with filters available to view open, unresolved, or all requests based on user permissions. ​
* **Copy and Reuse Requests:** Users can copy existing requests to create new ones, making it easier to submit similar requests without starting from scratch.
