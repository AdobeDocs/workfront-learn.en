## Key takeaways

* **Locate Requests Easily:** Use filters like "My open requests" or "My requests" in the "Requests" section to find submitted requests. ​ Adjust filters to view requests created by others or completed ones.
* **Check Status Before Updating:** Review the "status" and "converted to" columns to determine if the request is resolved or converted into a task/project. ​ Updates may need to be made in the converted item instead. ​
* **Update Requests Efficiently:** Open the summary panel by selecting the request and clicking the open summary icon. ​ Add updates in the "start a new update" field, tag users with @username, and click "update." ​
* **Access Full Request Details:** Open the request by clicking its name to view detailed information, including progress, assigned user, planned completion date, and status. ​ Use the left panel to access updates, documents, and request details.
* **Centralized Collaboration:** Adobe Workfront keeps all request information in one place, allowing users to review, update, and collaborate effectively using the latest information. ​
