# Convert an issue/request to a task

An issue may be significant enough that the time and effort to resolve it needs to be accounted for in the project timeline and allocate the appropriate resources. In this case, the issue can be converted into a task.

1. Navigate to the [!UICONTROL Issues] section of the project or task the issue is logged on. Or find the issue in a report that you have access to.
1. Click the issue name to open it.
1. From the 3-dot menu to the right of the issue name, select **[!UICONTROL Convert to task]**.
1. Fill out the [!UICONTROL Convert to task] form. Start by giving the new task a name and description.
1. If the new task should be part of a different project, enter the project name.
1. In the [!UICONTROL Options] section, check the boxes to keep the original issue, allow access to the new task, and maintain the completion date. Follow your organization's workflow when making these selections. 
1. Attach a custom form if you want to transfer custom form data from the issue to the task. (All fields that exist in both the issue form and the task form will transfer automatically to the task form.)
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Convert to task]** to finish.

Depending on your organization's [!DNL Workfront] system settings, you may or may not be able to change the settings in the Options section when you're converting the task. These options affect both the original issue and the new task.

* **"Keep the original issue and tie its resolution to this task"** retains the original issue and related information (hours, documents, etc.). With this option selected, when the task is completed, the issue will be marked as resolved. If this option is **not** selected, the original issue will be deleted on task creation. This can affect how your organization tracks and reports on issues.
* The **"Allow (user's name) to have access to this task"** option will allow the person who created the issue to have access to this new task.
* The **"Keep the planned completion date of the issue"** option allows you to keep the planned completion date already set on the issue. This sets the task constraint to [!UICONTROL Finish No Later Than]. If the box is unchecked, the dates of the task will be set as if a new task is created within the project.

The new task is placed at the bottom of the task list on your project. Move the task to the desired location, assign a user or team to the work, add planned hours and duration, etc.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot add issues to the project timeline, since they represent "unplanned work." The project timeline is for "planned work," meaning tasks.
