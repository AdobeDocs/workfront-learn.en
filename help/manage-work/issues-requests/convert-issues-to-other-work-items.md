## Key takeaways

* **Simple Conversion Process:** To convert an issue/request into a task, open the issue, click the three-dot menu, and select "Convert to Task." ​ The task name and description are copied by default but can be edited. ​
* **Destination Project Selection:** You can choose the destination project for the task, either the default project where the issue resides or another project you have access to. ​
* **Automatic Form Attachment:** Custom forms linked to the issue are automatically added to the task, ensuring all field values are carried over seamlessly. ​
* **Conversion Options:** Key options include:
    * Keeping the original issue active alongside the task. ​
    * Allowing the requester access to the task. ​
    * Retaining the issue's planned completion date for the task. ​
* **Linked Status Updates:** If the original issue is kept, its status will automatically update based on the task's progress, ensuring synchronization between the issue and task. ​


>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot add issues to the project timeline, since they represent "unplanned work." The project timeline is for "planned work," meaning tasks.
