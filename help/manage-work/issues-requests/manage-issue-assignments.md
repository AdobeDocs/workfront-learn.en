## Key takeaways

* **Assigning Issues:** Use inline editing in the assignments field to assign issues to users or teams, and ensure you click "save" after making assignments. ​ Team leads can use the workload balancer to assign tasks by dragging and dropping them onto team members' calendars. ​
* **Finding Assigned Issues:** Issues assigned to you appear in the Home work list, which can be filtered. ​ Team-assigned issues are visible in the team request section, where team members can accept or reassign tasks. ​ These issues also appear in the workload balancer for better visibility. ​
* **Updating Progress:** Post updates and log hours on issues to provide visibility into work progress. ​ Use the "At name" feature to direct comments to specific users or teams. ​ Notifications are sent for comments but not for logged hours or status changes. ​
* **Changing Issue Status:** Update the issue status to reflect progress, such as "working on it" or "complete." ​ Unresolved issues prevent associated tasks and projects from being marked as complete. ​
* **Team-Specific Workflows:** Follow your organization's specific workflows and system configurations for managing issues effectively. ​
