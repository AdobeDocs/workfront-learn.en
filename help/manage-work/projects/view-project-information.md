# View project information

This video provides an overview of filters, views, and groupings in Workfront to help users efficiently manage and analyze projects, tasks, and issues. ​ Key points include:

* **Project Filters:** Filters can be customized to narrow down project lists. ​ Examples include "Projects I Own," "Projects I'm On," "Current," and "Behind Schedule." ​ Filters like "At Risk" and "Behind Schedule" are explained in detail, showing how they rely on different fields.
* **Project Views:** Views display various project details, such as planned, projected, and actual start/completion dates. ​ Examples include the "Standard View," "All Dates View," and "Real Story View," which provides condition updates and summaries. ​
* **Project Groupings:** Projects can be grouped by fields like progress status or completion date by month, allowing for better organization and analysis. ​
* **Task Filters:** Filters help identify unassigned tasks or tasks relevant to specific roles. ​ Clearing filters reveals the parent task structure, and sorting can be adjusted by task number. ​
* **Task Views:** Views like "Status View" show task statuses and flags for progress, comments, documents, issues, approvals, critical paths, and milestones.
* **Task Groupings:** Similar to project groupings, tasks can be grouped by fields like progress status. ​
* **Issues:** Filters, views, and groupings for issues are similar to those for projects and tasks. ​ Popular views include "Entry Information," and groupings like "Primary Contact" help organize issues. ​

The video emphasizes customization and provides links to tutorials for further learning. ​
