# Understand project communication

As the saying goes, 90 percent of managing a project is communication. Communication with the project team, your managers, and project stakeholders.

But when project teams use email, instant messaging, meetings, and sticky notes for project communication, information gets scattered ... or worse, forgotten. Keep communication about project work on the project itself in [!DNL Workfront] using updates.

As project team members are working on assignments, they can make updates from [!DNL Workfront] [!UICONTROL Home] on the tasks assigned to them.

Updates from tasks, issues, and documents roll up to the project-level [!UICONTROL Updates] tab, making information quick and easy to view.

Then you can reply to updates, simply by clicking the button. This keeps all conversation in one place, allowing you to refer back to it later.
