# Understand project communication

The video emphasizes the importance of effective communication for project success and provides strategies to ensure clarity and efficiency in project management. ​ Key points include:
* **Stakeholder Communication:** Keep stakeholders informed about project progress, issues, and resolutions. ​ Regular updates tailored to their needs are essential. ​
* **Task Clarity:** Ensure team members understand their responsibilities to avoid scope creep and confusion. ​ Use sub-tasks for clarity when assigning multiple people to a task. ​
* **Centralized Communication:** Use tools like Workfront to store all project-related discussions in one place. ​ Notifications can help team members stay engaged in discussions. ​
* **Status Updates:** Encourage team members to regularly update task status and percent complete for accurate reporting. ​ Short, specific tasks improve reporting accuracy. ​
* **Issue Management:** Clearly define how team members should handle questions or concerns. ​ Issues must be resolved before project completion, while updates provide ongoing context. ​
* **Reporting:** Use project reports to summarize progress for upper management. ​ Tools like Note Search can help locate specific updates within threads. ​
* **Lessons Learned:** Plan a post-project meeting to improve future projects. ​

The video highlights how Workfront simplifies communication, task management, and reporting, ensuring all project-related information is accessible and organized. ​
