# Understand the [!UICONTROL Board] view

The video explains the Board view feature in Workfront, which provides an alternative way to view and manage project tasks. ​ In the Board view, tasks are displayed as cards on a Kanban-style board, allowing users to sort, group, and move tasks within or between columns. ​ Moving a task updates its status automatically, which is reflected in the task list view. ​ Users can create new cards, which generate new tasks in the project, and edit or assign them directly in the Board view. ​ Columns and cards can be configured, and tasks can be sequenced using predecessors in the task list view.
