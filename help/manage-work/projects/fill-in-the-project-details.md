## Key takeaways

* **Use Descriptive Project Names:** Avoid confusion by naming projects descriptively instead of using generic titles. ​ Organizing projects into portfolios and programs enhances reporting and consistency. ​
* **Set Appropriate Project Status:** Begin with "Planning" status when creating a project, then switch to "Current" when the project goes live. ​ Non-"Current" statuses pause notifications, allowing for replanning without disruptions. ​
* **Leverage Templates and Custom Forms:** Use project templates for consistency and custom forms to store unique project data. ​ These tools simplify setup and ensure essential information is captured.
* **Utilize Resource Pools and Schedules:** Assign resource pools to projects for effective resource management and apply the correct schedule to reflect workdays, hours, and holidays. ​ This ensures smooth project execution and resource allocation.
