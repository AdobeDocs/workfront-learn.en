# Share a project

The video explains how to share projects effectively in Workfront to ensure stakeholders and collaborators have the necessary visibility and access. ​ Workfront simplifies sharing by automatically assigning appropriate access rights based on roles:

**Automatic Sharing:**
* Project creators have managed rights to view and edit the project, tasks, and issues.
* Workers assigned to tasks gain view rights for the entire project and contributor rights for their tasks.
* Project sponsors can view the project, while resource managers can manage it but cannot delete it.

**Manual Sharing:**
* Projects can be shared with individuals, teams, job roles, groups, or companies.
* Best practices include creating teams with sharing in mind and using portfolios or programs to inherit permissions across multiple projects.

**Bulk and Template Sharing:**
* Bulk edit allows sharing adjustments for multiple projects. ​
* Sharing settings can be pre-configured in project templates to save time. ​

**System Defaults:**
* System administrators or group administrators can modify default sharing settings, such as granting contributor rights to team members assigned to tasks.

The video emphasizes using teams and templates for efficient sharing management and highlights the role of administrators in customizing sharing preferences.

## Key takeaways

* **Automatic Access Rights:** Workfront automatically assigns appropriate access rights based on roles (e.g., project creators, workers, sponsors, and resource managers) to simplify sharing. ​
* **Flexible Sharing Options:** Projects can be shared with individuals, teams, job roles, groups, or companies, and permissions can be inherited through portfolios or programs. ​
* **Efficient Team Management:** Adding or removing members from teams automatically updates their access rights across shared objects, making team-based sharing the easiest method. ​
* **Template Sharing:** Pre-configuring sharing settings in project templates ensures consistent access rights for all projects created using the template, saving time. ​
* **Customizable System Defaults:** System administrators can modify default sharing settings, such as granting contributor rights to team members assigned to tasks, to align with organizational preferences. ​
