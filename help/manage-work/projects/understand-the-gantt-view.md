# Understand the [!UICONTROL Gantt] view

The video explains how to use the Project Gantt Chart and Task Gantt Chart to visualize and manage tasks and projects effectively. ​ Gantt charts provide a big-picture view of tasks, templates, and projects, and are commonly used within portfolios to understand relationships between projects, especially those sharing resources. ​

**Key features of the Project Gantt Chart include:**

* Viewing actual dates (green triangles), percent complete, milestone diamonds, milestone lines, and cross-project predecessors.​
* Progress status indicators: green (on-time), yellow (at-risk), and red (in trouble).
* Displaying projected start and completion dates alongside planned dates.
* Showing tasks within projects for a quick overview.

**Key features of the Task Gantt Chart include:**

* Viewing actual dates, assignments (task owner and allocation percentage), baselines, commit dates, and percent complete.
* Highlighting the critical path (red) and marking milestone tasks with diamonds or lines.
* Checking predecessors within and across projects.​
* Progress status indicators: green (on-time), yellow (behind), light blue (at-risk), and red (late).
* Displaying projected dates for tasks.

The video emphasizes the flexibility of Gantt charts, allowing users to customize views and display multiple elements simultaneously for better project management.

## Key takeaways

**Big-Picture View:** Gantt charts provide a comprehensive overview of tasks, projects, and portfolios, making it easy to understand relationships and resource sharing across projects. ​
**Progress Tracking:** Progress status indicators (green, yellow, red, and light blue) help monitor project and task timelines, highlighting on-time, at-risk, behind, or late statuses. ​
**Milestone Management:** Milestone diamonds and lines visually mark key completion dates, aiding in tracking milestone progress within projects. ​
**Predecessor Insights:** Cross-project and task-specific predecessors can be easily checked, ensuring dependencies are clear and manageable. ​
**Customization Options:** Users can display actual dates, projected dates, baselines, assignments, and more, tailoring the Gantt chart view to their specific needs.
