## Key takeaways

* **Percent Complete Calculation:** The overall project progress is calculated based on the Percent Complete values of individual tasks, weighted by their duration or planned hours. ​
* **Planned vs. Projected Dates:** Workfront calculates planned and projected start/completion dates based on task durations and predecessors. ​ Discrepancies between these dates indicate potential delays. ​
* **Project Condition Status:** The condition field (e.g., On Target, At Risk, In Trouble) reflects the project's status and can be set manually or automatically using Progress Status mode. ​
* **Open Issues Management:** Open issues signal potential risks. ​ Reviewing and converting them into tasks promptly is essential for maintaining project timelines. ​
* **Condition Update Column:** Weekly updates from the project manager in the Condition Update column provide a clear summary of progress and help track the latest developments. ​
