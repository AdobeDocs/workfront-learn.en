# Track overall project progress

The header at the top of a project lets you see the overall project status and health with just a glance.

![Project header showing [!UICONTROL Percent Complete]](assets/planner-fund-percent-complete.png)

The [!UICONTROL Percent Complete] is based on the overall progress of the tasks in the project. The number is most accurate when team members change the status of their assigned tasks and indicate a percent complete.

>[!NOTE]
>
>A global system setting affects how the project’s percent complete is calculated, based either on durations or planned hours of the tasks.

The project [!UICONTROL Condition] is referred to as the “health of the project schedule.” There are a number of things that factor into how condition is calculated. [!DNL Workfront] looks at the [!UICONTROL Planned Completion Date] and the [!UICONTROL Projected Completion Date], as well as the critical path, to calculate if the project is [!UICONTROL On Time], [!UICONTROL At Risk], or [!UICONTROL In Trouble].

>[!NOTE]

>Whether the project condition is set automatically by [!DNL Workfront] or manually by someone with manage rights to the project is controlled by the [!UICONTROL Condition Type] setting in the [!UICONTROL Overview] section of the [!UICONTROL Project Details] page.
