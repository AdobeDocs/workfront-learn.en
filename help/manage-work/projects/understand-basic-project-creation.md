# Understand basic project creation

This video explains how to create and manage a project from scratch. ​ It begins by creating a new project, renaming it, and setting a goal with a description, start date, and target completion date. Projects can be broken into tasks, which are planned work with estimated durations and assignments. ​ Tasks can be sequenced using predecessors, and the project status can be set to "Current" to notify the team and include it in reports. ​

## Key takeaways

* **Creating a Project:** Start by creating a new project, renaming it, and setting a goal, description, start date, and target completion date.
* **Breaking Down Work:** Divide the project into individual tasks, estimate durations, assign responsibilities, and sequence tasks using predecessors. ​
* **Handling Issues:** Manage unexpected issues by converting them into tasks, moving them to another project, or marking them as "Won't Resolve." ​
* **Adjusting Timelines:** Adding tasks may affect the project timeline, but overlapping tasks can help maintain the original completion date. ​
* **Completion Criteria:** A project is considered complete when all tasks are finished and any issues are resolved. ​ Beginners should start with simple projects and gradually explore advanced features. ​
