# Change the project status

One of the final [!DNL Workfront] steps for closing out a project is changing the status to Complete. Status does two main things in [!DNL Workfront]:

* Lets everyone know what stage of development the project is in.
* Tells [!DNL Workfront] when to send out notifications and when not to.

With the Complete status, you’re letting everyone know the project work is complete—deliverable is done, outcome achieved, goal met.

And you’re telling [!DNL Workfront] to stop sending notifications related to the project.

Change the status in the:

* Project header
* Project details
* Or from a list or report that displays the project status column

## Why change the status?

It seems obvious that when closing a project, an important step is to change the status to Complete. But [!DNL Workfront] has found that sometimes this step is overlooked. Why?

In some cases, organizations don’t have an established process for closing out projects. The project manager and others involved know the work is done, so they just move on to the next thing.

In other situations, the project percent complete is at 100 percent because all of the tasks are completed. Sometimes project managers assume 100 percent complete means a Complete status. But that’s not always the case.

Forgetting to update the project status can affect your organization’s reporting. In turn, this can affect resource planning, financial forecasting, and future project commitments.
