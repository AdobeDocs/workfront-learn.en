## Manage a project - review

With each project you manage, you'll settle into a routine of when to review projects and what you want to review each time. Staying on top of your projects and driving them to success is what being a project manager is all about.

Every project manager handles their projects a bit differently. And every team, department, or organization may have different project requirements and needs.

But no matter how you manage a project, you'll want to:

* Ensure work is being completed on time.
* Anticipate problems and risks.
* Communicate with your stakeholders.
* Celebrate the wins along the way.

Ultimately, your main job is to drive the project toward successful completion. [!DNL Workfront] can help you monitor the work being done through the project timeline; filters, views, and groupings; updates; reports ... and more.
