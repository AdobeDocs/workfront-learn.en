## Key takeaways

* **Progress Monitoring:** Projects with "Current" status appear in reports, allowing managers to track progress (on schedule, behind, or past due). ​
* **Cross-Project Dependencies:** Dependencies can be managed and viewed in the Project Gantt view, with options to drill down for detailed insights. ​
* **Task and Approval Management:** Use the Status and Approvals tabs to track task completion, pending approvals, and communicate via comments. ​
* **Team Communication:** Easily send updates to all team members using the "Update All" feature and keep a record of discussions in the project. ​
* **Frequent Updates:** Workers should update task statuses daily to ensure smooth project management and accurate tracking. ​
