## Manage a project - review

With each project you manage, you'll settle into a routine of when to review projects and what you want to review each time. Staying on top of your projects and driving them to success is what being a project manager is all about.

Every project manager handles their projects a bit differently. And every team, department, or organization may have different project requirements and needs.

But no matter how you manage a project, you'll want to:

* Ensure work is being completed on time.
* Anticipate problems and risks.
* Communicate with your stakeholders.
* Celebrate the wins along the way.

Ultimately, your main job is to drive the project toward successful completion. Adobe Workfront can help you monitor the work being done through the project timeline; filters, views, and groupings; updates; reports ... and more.
