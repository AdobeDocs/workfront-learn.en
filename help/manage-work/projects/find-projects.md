## Key takeaways

* **Filters and Search Options:** Use filters and search tools, including Advanced Search, to quickly locate specific projects based on names, descriptions, or custom data fields. ​
* **Recents List:** Recently viewed projects automatically appear in the Recents list, which can display up to 20 projects for quick access. ​
* **Favorites:** Mark projects as favorites by clicking the star icon. ​ Favorites remain accessible until manually removed, making them ideal for frequently accessed projects. ​
* **Pinning Projects:** Pin projects to keep them easily accessible. ​ Pinned projects stay visible until you unpin them.
* **Custom Reports and Dashboards:** Create custom reports and dashboards to organize and access all relevant projects efficiently. ​
