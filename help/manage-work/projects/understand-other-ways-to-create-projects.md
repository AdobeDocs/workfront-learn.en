## Pro tips

* The [!UICONTROL New Project from Template] window makes it easy to select the right template for your project. Scroll through the left panel to find a template, then select it to get a preview of its contents. This preview shows you how many tasks are in the template, the required job roles, and more.

* If there’s a template you use frequently, make it a favorite! You’ll see the template listed in the [!UICONTROL New Project] menu, in addition to it appearing under the [!UICONTROL Favorites and Recents] icon in the navigation bar. Just click the favorite star icon wherever you see it—on the template page, while choosing a template to create your project with, etc.
