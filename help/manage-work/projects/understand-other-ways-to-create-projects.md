# Learn four ways to create a project

The video provides a comprehensive guide on creating projects in Workfront using various methods:

**Creating a Project from a Template:**

* Navigate to the Projects page, click "New Project," and select "New Project from Template." ​
* Browse active templates, preview summaries (e.g., duration, owner, task summary, custom forms), and select a template. ​
* Favorite templates can be accessed directly for quicker selection. ​
* Fill out initial information (e.g., project name) and click "Create Project." ​ Fields can be edited later. ​

**Creating a Project from Scratch:**

* Go to the Projects page, click "New Project," and select "New Project." ​
* Name the project and edit details like sharing options, custom data, portfolio, and program. ​
* Defaults set by the group or system administrator can be accepted or changed. ​
* Save the project, which is initially shared only with the creator and system administrators. ​
* Tasks can be added by typing names, with fields like duration and planned hours editable. ​

**Copying a Project:**

* Open an existing project, click the three-dot menu, and select "Copy." ​
* Change the name, status (e.g., Planning), and deselect items not to be copied (e.g., expenses). ​
* Edit details like the planned start date after copying. ​

**Importing a Microsoft Project File:**

* Save the MS Project file as an XML file. ​
* Use the "Import MS Project" option in the New Project menu, select the file, and begin the import. ​
* Some MS Project settings (e.g., comments, custom forms, milestones) will not transfer. ​
* Set the status to Planning to review and edit the imported project before it goes live. ​


The video emphasizes the flexibility of Workfront in creating projects through templates, scratch, copying, or importing, catering to different user needs. ​

## Key takeaways


**Templates Simplify Project Creation:**
Using a template is highly recommended as it can pre-set key details like tasks, forms, and sharing options, saving time and effort. ​

**Favorite Templates for Quick Access:**
Favorite templates allow users to bypass the selection process and directly create a project, streamlining workflow. ​

**Creating Projects from Scratch Offers Flexibility:**
While more manual, creating a project from scratch allows customization of all details, ideal for simple or private projects. ​

**Copying Projects Saves Time:**
Copying an existing project replicates its structure and settings, with options to modify or exclude specific elements. ​

**Importing MS Project Files for Transition:**
Workfront supports importing MS Project files (saved as XML), enabling users to transition ongoing projects, though some data (e.g., comments, milestones) won't transfer. ​
