## Key takeaways

* **Automatic Team Population:** The project team is automatically populated when users are assigned tasks or designated as project owners. ​ However, users are not automatically removed when their assignments are removed; this must be done manually. ​
* **Manual Updates:** You can manually add or remove people from the project team, even if they don't have assignments, ensuring the team list stays accurate and up-to-date. ​
* **Centralized Communication:** The People tab allows you to send updates to all team members at the project level, making it a convenient tool for team-wide communication. ​
* **Email Notifications:** System administrators can activate email notifications for the project team, such as alerts for added documents, completed milestone tasks, or issues, ensuring team members stay informed. ​
* **Project Involvement Tracking:** Workfront uses the project team to identify which projects a user is involved in, enabling features like filtering projects by user involvement for easier navigation. ​
