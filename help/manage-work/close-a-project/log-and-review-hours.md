# Log and review hours

If logging actual hours worked is part of your organizationâ€™s workflow, you can review those hours on the [!UICONTROL Hours] section (select it from the left panel menu) on the project. This shows all hours logged on individual tasks and the project itself. You can also log hours from this page.

>Your organization may ask you to approve hours through [!DNL Workfront] timesheets. Check with your internal [!DNL Workfront] team to see what process you should use.
