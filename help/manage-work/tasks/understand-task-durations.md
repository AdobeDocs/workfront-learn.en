# Understand task durations

This video explains task durations in Workfront, their impact on task start and completion dates, project timelines, and best practices for using durations effectively. 
Workfront recommends using durations and predecessors to establish task timelines rather than manually setting constraints, as constraints can prevent automatic adjustments. 
​Accurate durations are critical for effective project planning and resource management.

## Key takeaways

* **Definition of Task Duration:** Task duration is the difference between a task's planned start date and planned completion date, representing the time window for completing the work. ​
* **Impact on Project Timeline:** Task durations directly affect the overall project length and planned completion date, making them crucial for accurate project planning. ​
* **Use of Predecessors:** Planned start and completion dates are calculated using task durations and predecessors, ensuring a dynamic and flexible timeline. ​
* **Avoid Manual Constraints:** Manually setting start or completion dates creates task constraints, which can prevent automatic adjustments when durations or predecessors change. ​
* **Resource Management:** Durations are essential for Workfront's resource management and scheduling tools, enabling accurate resource estimates and team availability planning. ​
