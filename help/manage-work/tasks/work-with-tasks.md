## Key takeaways

* **In-Line Editing for Quick Changes:** Double-click a field to edit task information directly, and use the Tab key to navigate between fields for faster updates. ​
* **Deleting Tasks with Recycle Bin Backup:** Deleted tasks are moved to the Recycle Bin for 30 days, accessible only by system administrators, ensuring recoverability if needed. ​
* **Adding Tasks with Parent-Child Structure:** Use "Insert Above" or "Insert Below" to add tasks in specific locations, inheriting the parent-child structure of the selected task. ​
* **Duplicating Tasks for Efficiency:** Duplicate tasks or sets of tasks to save time, with all task details copied for easy modification and repositioning. ​
* **Reorganizing Tasks with Indent, Outdent, and Drag-and-Drop:** Adjust task hierarchy or move tasks within the project using intuitive tools like indenting, outdenting, and drag-and-drop functionality. ​
