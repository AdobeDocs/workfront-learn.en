# Understand parent-child tasks

This video explains the task structure in Workfront. Tasks are essential components of a project, representing the work items needed for completion.​ The video emphasizes the importance of organizing tasks accurately as a key step in project planning and management. It demonstrates how to start working with tasks and explains the parent-child task relationships. 
​Parent tasks act as organizers, grouping the project into phases, stages, or milestones, and are not assigned to individuals. Child tasks, or subtasks, represent actionable work assigned to team members.

## Key takeaways

* **Tasks as Project Backbone:** Tasks represent the work items required to complete a project and are crucial for effective project planning and management. ​
* **Parent-Child Task Structure:** Parent tasks group the project into phases, stages, or milestones, while child tasks (subtasks) represent actionable work assigned to team members. ​
* **Automatic Completion of Parent Tasks:** Parent tasks are automatically marked complete once all associated child tasks are finished. ​
* **Task Organization Tools:** Tasks can be organized using the indent and outdent buttons to create hierarchical structures, with up to seven levels of parent-child relationships supported.
* **Flexible Task Structuring:** Projects can use a parent-child structure or keep all tasks at the same level, depending on the specific needs of the project. ​
