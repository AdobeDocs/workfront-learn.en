## Change a task to a subtask and back again

The **indent** and **outdent** buttons are used to change a task to a subtask or from a subtask to a non-subtask.

Select "[!UICONTROL Watermark Design]" and click the **indent** button. "[!UICONTROL Watermark Design]" will become a subtask under "[!UICONTROL Conceptual Mockups]", which will become a parent task.

Select "[!UICONTROL Watermark Design]" when it is a subtask and click the **outdent** button. "[!UICONTROL Watermark Design]" will become a regular task at the same level as "[!UICONTROL Conceptual Mockups]".
