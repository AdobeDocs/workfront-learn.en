## Key takeaways

* **Predecessors Define Task Order:** Predecessors establish the sequence of tasks, ensuring certain tasks are completed before others can begin, which is crucial for project success. ​
* **Durations Impact Timelines:** Task durations set the time frame for work and adjust start and completion dates, creating a cascading effect on dependent tasks. ​
* **Templates Simplify Setup:** Predecessors and constraints can be pre-set in project templates, streamlining the process of managing task sequences. ​
* **Manual Adjustments Affect Constraints:** Manually setting specific dates overrides the cascading updates caused by changes to durations or predecessors. ​
* **Practice Improves Skills:** Practicing with predecessors and durations helps refine project management skills and ensures better control over timelines.
