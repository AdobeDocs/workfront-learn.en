## Key takeaways

* **Work Effort Feature for Estimating Planned Hours:** The Work Effort feature in Workfront helps estimate planned hours for tasks based on their duration, making it easier to create project plans when planned hours are difficult to estimate. ​
* **Customizable Work Effort Percentages:** Workfront calculates planned hours using percentages of task duration (e.g., Medium Work Effort = 50%, Large Work Effort = 75%), and these percentages can be adjusted as needed. ​
* **Simple Duration Type Requirement:** Work Effort is only available for tasks with a simple duration type. ​ Tasks with other duration types must be changed to simple before using Work Effort. ​
* **Inline and Bulk Editing Options:** Work Effort can be adjusted for individual tasks using Inline Edit or for multiple tasks simultaneously using the Bulk Edit feature. ​
* **Creating a Custom Work Effort View:** Users can create a custom Work Effort view to easily manage and edit Work Effort settings. ​ This involves adding columns for Work Effort and other relevant fields, such as Planned Hours or Duration Type. ​
