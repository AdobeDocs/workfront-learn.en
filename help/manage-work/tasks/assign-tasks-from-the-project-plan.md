## Key takeaways

* **Inline Editing for Quick Assignments:** Easily assign tasks by typing a name and selecting from a list, with type-ahead functionality for faster selection. ​
* **Bulk Editing for Efficiency:** Assign multiple tasks to the same person by selecting tasks, using bulk edit, and choosing the name from the list. ​
* **Job Roles for Streamlined Assignments:** Use job roles to facilitate task assignments, especially with project templates. ​ Job roles are recorded separately for resource management and capacity planning. ​
* **Team Assignments for Collaboration:** Assign tasks to teams by selecting the team name, visible with a team icon. ​ Team members can self-assign tasks or team leads can reassign them, while retaining the team name for reporting. ​
* **Resource Management Integration:** Job roles and team assignments support resource capacity and availability calculations, enhancing project planning and execution. ​
