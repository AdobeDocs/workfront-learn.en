## Key takeaways

* **Task Creation Methods:** Use the "New Task" button for detailed task creation or the "Add More Tasks" button for quick inline editing.
* **Required Fields:** ​Only the task name is mandatory; other fields like description, duration, and assignments are optional and can be added later. ​
* **Repositioning Tasks:** ​Tasks are added to the bottom of the list but can be repositioned by dragging or using the "Outdent" option to adjust hierarchy. 
* **Custom Views:** Different views can be selected to include additional fields, such as descriptions, while adding tasks. ​
* **Inserting Tasks at Specific Positions:** ​Right-click between existing tasks and select "Insert Task Below" to place a new task in a specific location.
