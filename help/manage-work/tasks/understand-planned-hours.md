# Understand planned hours

The video explains the concept of planned hours, which are estimates of the time required to complete tasks.
Planned hours are crucial for resource management in Workfront, helping identify over- or under-allocation of resources. 
They also assist in tracking time spent on tasks, improving future estimates, and clarifying expectations with workers.

## Key takeaways

* **Planned Hours Importance:** Planned hours help estimate task durations, manage resource allocation, and track time spent, improving future project planning. ​
* **Accurate Estimation Tips:** Break long tasks into smaller subtasks, track time effectively, and document changes or issues to refine planned hours estimates. ​
* **Resource Management:** Workfront uses planned hours to identify over- or under-allocation of resources, ensuring efficient task assignments. ​
* **Historical Reference:** Completed projects should be retained as references for future planning, especially for tasks assigned to new workers. ​
* **Ease of Use:** Planned hours can be added or edited using Inline Editing, and parent task hours are automatically calculated by summing subtasks. ​ Including planned hours in project templates is recommended. ​
