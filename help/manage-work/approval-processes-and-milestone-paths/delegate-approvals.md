## Delegate task and issue assignments

You can delegate the tasks and issues assigned to you to other users when you plan to be out of the office. 

### How to enable task and issue assignment delegation

Before it can be used, task and issue delegation must be enabled by a group or system administrator. This is done in [!UICONTROL Setup > Project Preferences > Tasks & Issues > Delegation]. Enabling this will allow all users with a Review or higher license to delegate their assigned tasks and issues.

### How to delegate task and issue assignments

Navigate to [!UICONTROL Home] and click [!UICONTROL Delegate], then specify the user you're delegating all your assigned tasks to and the date range. You can designate any user with a Review or higher license.
