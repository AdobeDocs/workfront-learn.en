# Understand cross-project predecessors

Cross project predecessors are an easy way to establish dependencies between tasks in different projects. For example, a construction company may have a project called **Build Access Road to Summerhill Housing Development**, and another project called **Build Model Home in Summerhill**. By making the first task in **Build Model Home** have a cross project predecessor of the last task in **Build Access Road**, you're making sure the access road is in place before you start building the home. Because the tasks are linked, if the **Build Access Road** project slips, the **Build Model Home** planned start date will automatically slip accordingly.
