# Understand date types and progress status

In this video, you will learn about:

* Planned, projected, and actual dates, and 
* How they are used in calculating progress status

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/335095/?quality=12&learn=on)

>[!NOTE]
>
>It's important for people to change the status from **[!UICONTROL New]** to **[!UICONTROL In Progress]** when they start a task so the [!UICONTROL Actual Start Date] will be correct. But if they forget to do this when they start the task they can go back and edit the [!UICONTROL Actual Start Date] at anytime.
