* Select a view to compare [!DNL Workfront's] different date types
* Use progress status to help you track work progress

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/335095/?quality=12&learn=on)

>[!NOTE]
>
>As stated in the video, it's important for people to change the status from **[!UICONTROL New]** to **[!UICONTROL In Progress]** when they start a task so the [!UICONTROL Actual Start Date] will be correct. But if they forget to do this when they start the task they can go back and edit the [!UICONTROL Actual Start Date] at anytime.
