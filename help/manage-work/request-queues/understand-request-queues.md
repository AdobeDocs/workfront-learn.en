## Request drafts save automatically

As you start filling in a request form, [!DNL Workfront] saves a draft automatically after you fill in the [!UICONTROL Subject] field. This means you won’t lose data if you need to navigate away from the [!UICONTROL Requests] area to do something else or if you need to pause in the middle of your request to gather more information.

You’ll see an indication that the draft has saved at the top of the window. [!DNL Workfront] will save a draft of your request, even if required fields aren’t filled in yet.

When you’re ready to submit the request, find it in the [!UICONTROL Drafts] tab. Click the name to open it and finish filling out the form. Then click [!UICONTROL Submit Request] when you’re done.

You can also access request drafts from the [!UICONTROL Select a Request Type] menu at the top of the window. Select an option from the [!UICONTROL Recent Drafts] section, or start a new request by picking a queue from the [!UICONTROL New Requests] section. Fill everything out like normal, then submit the request.
