## Frequently asked questions

**Why can I see a request queue, but my user cannot?**

In the Queue Details tab of your request queue/project, ensure your user fits the criteria of the “Who can add requests to this queue?” field.

**I gave users access to the queue, but now they can also see the request queue project. Why?**

This has to do with how you gave them access to the request queue.

If you used the Sharing tool from the request queue project landing page, then you have given those users access to see the project in the list of projects.

If, however, you wanted to give them access only to submit a request to the queue, go to Queue Setup and select the appropriate option under "Who can add requests to this project."

**Can I turn my request into a project?**

Yes. You can convert issues into tasks or projects depending on what is needed.

**Where do I find a request queue to make edits?**
You can either use the Search field in the navigation bar or find it listed in the Projects area.

**Can I transfer the information from a request custom form to a project?**

Yes. When you create a custom form select both [!UICONTROL Project] and [!UICONTROL Issue] as the object types. Attach the custom form to the request. When you convert the request to a project the custom form will automatically attach to the new project and the values contained in any fields will appear in both the request and the project.

**I’m looking at a project or task report. How can I find out what request this object originated from?**

You can use the **[!UICONTROL Converted Issue Name]** field to add that information to your project and task reports.
