## Templates created with [!UICONTROL Blueprints] 

  Workfront users can use [!UICONTROL Blueprints] to help build project templates. This feature, located in the Main Menu, allows you to access pre-built, ready-to-use templates that are targeted to a department and specific maturity level. These templates give users a head start to repeatable project creation and help maintain consistency across projects similar in scope.

Any licensed user can browse the list of blueprints available in Workfront. You cannot apply a blueprint directly when creating a new project (such as converting a task or request into a project). A key difference between a blueprint and a project template is that a blueprint is used to make a template, whereas a template is used to create a project. **The blueprint needs to be installed by a system administrator for the corresponding template to be created.**

If you find a blueprint that looks interesting, you can click on **[!UICONTROL Details]** to learn more about it.

The [!UICONTROL Details] screen explains more about the blueprint, including the installation history if the blueprint has been installed.
