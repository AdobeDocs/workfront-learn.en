# Workfront for executives

## Reports and Dashboards

### Reports

Reports in Workfront are the backbone to making better decisions, faster. You can see them everywhere you go--in the projects area, the people area, or on a task landing page.

Leaders and executives can navigate to the report area to view custom reports with specific information. To increase visibility to the most important reports, Workfront uses dashboards. 

### Dashboards 

By using a dashboard, leaders can view and quickly drill down into any part of the work their organization is currently working on.The dashboard is simply a collection of reports that provide information leaders may need to see on a regular basis. Dashboards are completely customizable so anyone using Workfront can see work that matters to them. 

Click Dashboards from the Main menu icon in the upper-right corner to access the Dashboards area.

* **All Dashboards**: Displays the dashboards that you or other users have created, and which you have permissions to at least View.
* **My Dashboards**: Displays the dashboards that you have built.
* **Shared Dashboards**: Displays the dashboards that have been created by other users and shared with you.

With a dashboard, leaders are able to review things like “Costs, Revenues & Budgets,” for important projects and open issues their teams are dealing with. They can also see projects that are at risk, as well as a list of items that need executive approval.

Reports in Workfront can help drive accountability for your employees. The key to leveraging reports is to establish a clear workflow for the way your organization is using them. Make sure everyone has a clear understanding of which reports are being used to measure success.
