# Modify user profile information

There may be times when you need to edit users in Workfront. For example, a user changes positions within the company, so different Workfront permissions are needed. 

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Users]** from the [!UICONTROL Main Menu].
1. Click the user’s name in the list. This opens the profile page in [!DNL Workfront].
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Edit]** from the 3-dot menu in the page header.
1. The user’s profile page opens, allowing you to edit personal information, preferences, notifications, access level, organization options, resource planning settings, and custom forms.
1. Click [!UICONTROL Save Changes].

## Edit multiple users

[!DNL Workfront’s] bulk edit feature allows you to edit multiple users at the same time. This is helpful when the same information about several people needs to change, such as reassigning an access level or changing team assignments.

Check the boxes next to the users you want to edit. Then click the [!UICONTROL Edit] button to open the user details. The changes you make apply to all the selected users.
