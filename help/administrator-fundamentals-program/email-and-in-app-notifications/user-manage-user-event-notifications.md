# Manage in-app and email event notifications

An event is something like a change in status, a comment posted, or an assignment made and can trigger an in-app notification in [!DNL Workfront].

However, you can determine which events you would like to receive email notifications for by selecting, or deselecting, the options in your preferences.

To make those changes, click your name from the [!UICONTROL Main Menu].

Click [!UICONTROL Edit] from the [!UICONTROL More] menu.

Click [!UICONTROL Notifications] in the [!UICONTROL Edit Person] pop-up box.

From here, you can decide which notifications you would like to receive instantly, daily, or not at all. Any changes you make here are specific to you and do not affect any other user in Workfront.

**[!UICONTROL Daily]**

By default, emails are set up to be sent instantly. However, you can switch the email notification frequency from [!UICONTROL Instant] to [!UICONTROL Daily], ensuring that you get the information you need, when you want it.

The daily option sends a digest of the day’s events in one email. Users get one email for each grouping they see in the [!UICONTROL Notifications] section. 

For example, the [!UICONTROL Information about Projects I Own] section will generate one daily email, the [!UICONTROL Action Needed] section will generate one daily email, etc.

In addition to selecting the daily option, set a time for those emails to be sent. Depending on what works best, digest emails could be sent before you come into work in the morning or just before you leave for the day.

**Not At All**

The final option is to turn the email notifications off entirely.

If you decide to do this, know that although you’re not receiving emails, work is still being assigned, commented on, and updated within [!DNL Workfront]. By turning off all notifications, you may be missing important information you need to be aware of.

There are a few instances when [!DNL Workfront] has seen users turn off email notifications. For example, if you do most of your work through the [!DNL Workfront] mobile app, you could turn off your email notifications and receive notifications only through the app.

Regardless of the [!UICONTROL Event Notifications] you decide to receive, notifications are important to the success of work being done for your organization’s goals.
