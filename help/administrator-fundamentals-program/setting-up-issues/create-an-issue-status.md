# Create an issue status

[!DNL Workfront] recommends you modify existing issue statues in your system before you start creating new statuses. This helps limit the number of statuses that need to be maintained.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Setup]** in the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]**.
1. Expand the **[!UICONTROL Project Preferences]** section in the left menu panel.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Statuses]**.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Issues]** tab.
1. Make sure the field in the upper-right is set to [!UICONTROL System Statuses]. This ensures the new status is available globally across your [!DNL Workfront] instance.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Master List ]**to see all issue statuses. This is where you create or modify a status.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add a New Status]**.
1. Complete the fields as needed for your organization â€” name, description, color, equates with, key, etc.
1. Check the boxes for the type of issue this status can be used with.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
