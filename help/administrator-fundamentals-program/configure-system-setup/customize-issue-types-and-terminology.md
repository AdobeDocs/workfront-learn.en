# Customize issue types and terminology

## Rename the default issue types

[!DNL Workfront] provides four types of issues to help your users to categorize the kind of issue being created. The defaults are:

* [!UICONTROL Bug Report]
* [!UICONTROL Change Order]
* [!UICONTROL Issue]
* [!UICONTROL Request]

What if the existing issue types don’t match the issue management needs of your organization? Or maybe your organization uses different terminology?

For example, there’s a team that would like to track project risks using [!DNL Workfront] issues. As the system administrator, you know your organization doesn’t track bug reports. So you can change the name of an unused issue type, like [!UICONTROL Bug Reports], to Project Risks.

Issue types are renamed at a system-wide level, so the change applies to all [!DNL Workfront] users.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Setup]** in the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]**.
1. Expand the **[!UICONTROL Project Preferences]** section in the left menu panel.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Statuses]**.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Issues]** tab.
1. Make sure the menu in the upper-right is set to [!UICONTROL System Statuses].
1. Hover the cursor next to an issue type at the top of the list. Click the pencil icon to enable field editing.
1. Rename the issue type.
1. Click outside the field to save.

## Change the term “issue” in Workfront

Some organizations use a term other than “issue” to refer to unplanned work items. Issue is [!DNL Workfront’s] default term and appears throughout the software — menus, reports, field names, etc.

System and group administrators can use the layout template functionality to rename the issue item to match their organization’s terminology. The new term then appears throughout [!DNL Workfront] for those who are assigned to the layout template.
