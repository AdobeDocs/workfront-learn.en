# Overview of issues in [!DNL Workfront]

In addition to projects and tasks, [!DNL Workfront] provides an opportunity to track unplanned work, known as an issue. Unplanned work could be a problem that arises when working on a task, an unexpected expense on a project, or a request for a new item.

Because issues can take many forms, users need a way to sort and report on them separately. To support this need, [!DNL Workfront] offers:

* System-wide issue preferences.
* Four customizable issue types.
* Issue-specific statuses.
* Severities to rank an issueâ€™s importance or impact.
