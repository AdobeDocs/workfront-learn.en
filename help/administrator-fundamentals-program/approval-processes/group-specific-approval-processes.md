# Understand group-specific approval processes

Both system and group administrators can create approval processes in [!DNL Workfront]. System administrators can create processes for use throughout the [!DNL Workfront] system or ones just for a specific group. Group administrators can create or edit processes only for the group they manage.

For an approval process that can be used by everyone in [!DNL Workfront], make sure the [!UICONTROL “This approval process can be used by”] field is set to [!UICONTROL All groups].

The statuses available in the [!UICONTROL “Start Approval Process when the status is set to”] menu depend on the selection in the “used by” field. With [!UICONTROL All groups] selected, only the systemwide locked statuses are available.

To limit an approval process for a specific group, select that group’s name from the list for the [!UICONTROL “This approval process can be used by”] field.

The [!UICONTROL All groups] option is not available to group administrators.

When a specific group is selected, only the statuses available for that group show up in the [!UICONTROL “Start Approval Process when the status is set to”] menu.
