# Create a template with [!UICONTROL Blueprints]

[!DNL Adobe Workfront] system administrators can use [!UICONTROL Blueprints] to help build project templates. This feature, located in the [!UICONTROL Main Menu], allows you to access pre-built, ready-to-use templates that are targeted to a department and specific maturity level. These templates give users a head start to repeatable project creation and help maintain consistency across projects similar in scope. 

Although project templates made with blueprints can be used when creating projects, you cannot apply a blueprint directly when creating a new project (such as converting a task or request into a project). A key distinction between a blueprint and a project template is that a blueprint is used to make a template, whereas a project template is used to create a project.

To install a blueprint to your production or sandbox environments, select [!UICONTROL Blueprints] in the [!UICONTROL Main Menu] and browse through the template options to see which one fits your project needs the best. Configure details of the project template — such as mapping the blueprint’s job roles to your organization's job roles—before installing the blueprint, if needed. After installing the blueprint, you can make changes to the new template to suit your organization’s needs.
