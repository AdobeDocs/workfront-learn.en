>In order to create a project using this method, you need access to the [!UICONTROL Templates] area of [!DNL Workfront]. If you are unable to access templates, you can still use a template to create a project from the [!UICONTROL Projects] area or when converting an issue/task. Refer to the Planner Fundamentals course for details.

## Pro tip

If there’s a template you use frequently, make it a favorite! You’ll see the template listed in the New Project menu, in addition to it appearing under the Favorites and Recents menu in the navigation bar.
