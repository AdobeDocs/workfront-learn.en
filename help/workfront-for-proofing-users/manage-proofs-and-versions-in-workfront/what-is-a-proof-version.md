# What is a proof version?

[!DNL Workfront’s] proofing features help you manage the review and approval process across multiple iterations of a file using versions.

A basic definition of a version is a revised copy of a proof. For example, the handout for your organization’s booth at the trade show has gone through the initial review and approval process using proofing in [!DNL Workfront]. Corrections have been made by the creative team, so the updated file is ready for review.

You can upload the new file to [!DNL Workfront] as a version of the original file.

This “stacks” the version on top of the original file, maintaining a history of the revisions and allowing recipients to compare earlier versions to the current version. Using versions also ensures recipients are viewing the latest iteration of the work. The latest version in the stack is the one everyone sees in the [!UICONTROL Documents] list and when they open the proof.

Let’s get started creating proof versions.
