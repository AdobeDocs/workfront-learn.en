# Best Practice - Workfront Goals

## What is an Adobe Workfront “best practice”? 

Best practices are guidelines that represent an effective, efficient course of action; are easily adopted by you and the users at your company; and can be replicated successfully across your organization. 

As you review these recommendations, please keep in mind that some Workfront best practices are universal while others might be more specific to the topic. Use these best practices as a framework to help guide your Workfront system setups and use.

## Navigating this page 

As you scroll through this page, first you’ll find a high-level list of all the best practices for the topic. This allows you to review the recommendations without diving into the details of “why.” 

The “Why are these best practices?” area, found after the high-level list, provides greater detail into some of the best practices and why they're deemed as a process, tool, etc., you should consider implementing with your Workfront instance.

## Why are these best practices? 

**Best practice**

Start with 3-5 company-level goals at the most. 



**Here’s why**

Keep it simple. Before configuring your system, figure out 3-5 company-level goals. Doing this will not only allow you to ease into the Goals tool but also help you easily identify what your current most important priorities for the company are and determine the goals that will support those priorities.

</br>

**Best practice**

Assign the last goal in the hierarchy to an individual contributor. 



**Here’s why**

This creates personal responsibility toward achieving the overarching company goal.



Although you can create a complex hierarchy when you align goals, true goal hierarchy means that you have individual contributors at the last tier of each branch of goal alignment. This means they can update the progress on their own goals, which then updates the overarching team or group goal progress.

**Best practice**

Establish a cadence for how frequently you will review and adjust goals. 



**Here’s why**
 
Having a set cadence to review set goals and evaluate the business trajectory for the future can help your team stay on track and truly aligned with the company's vision.

</br>

**Best practice**

Start by creating filters for each group.



**Here’s why**

This will help narrow down the information you and your team need to understand what needs to be done and eliminates excess information that, for the time being, can be overwhelming.
