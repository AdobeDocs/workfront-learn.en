# Best Practice - Workload Balancer

## What is an Adobe Workfront “best practice”? 

Best practices are guidelines that represent an effective, efficient course of action; are easily adopted by you and the users at your company; and can be replicated successfully across your organization. 

As you review these recommendations, please keep in mind that some Workfront best practices are universal while others might be more specific to the topic. Use these best practices as a framework to help guide your Workfront system setups and use.

## Navigating this page 

As you scroll through this page, first you’ll find a high-level list of all the best practices for the topic. This allows you to review the recommendations without diving into the details of “why.” 

The “Why are these best practices?” area, found after the high-level list, provides greater detail into some of the best practices and why they're deemed as a process, tool, etc., you should consider implementing with your Workfront instance.

## Utilization best practices 

* Track progress, cost, and revenue with the Utilization report. 

* Assign resources to children tasks rather than to parent tasks to track the total hours logged in utilization reports.

## Workload Balancer best practices 

* Use the Workload Balancer to make sure the person you're assigning to a task/issue is available to complete it. 

* Associate schedules and job roles to user profiles.

## Why are these best practices? 

**Best practice**

Use the Workload Balancer to make sure the person you're assigning to a task/issue is available to complete it. 



**Here’s why**

The Workload Balancer provides a clear, visual mapping of resource overallocation and underutilization so you can easily see which team members have the bandwidth to complete the task or issue on time. 

 

Unlike making assignments at a task or issue level, the Workload Balancer takes a person’s time off and schedule exceptions details into account so you can allocate resources more accurately to avoid overloading your users. 

 

For example, when you assign someone to a task/issue from the item's page header or from a list of tasks/issues, you have almost no visibility into what else they're assigned to. You might get a warning if they used Workfront’s time-off calendar to indicate they’re gone, but you can't see what else they're assigned to that day or week. Using the Workload Balancer allows you to assign the right person to hold accountable for the progress of your work items.

**Best practice**

Associate schedules and job roles to user profiles. 



**Here’s why**

In order to get the most accurate information on the skills and availability of your resources, it’s recommended to associate schedules and job roles to your user profiles in Workfront. This information is used by several of Workfront’s resource management tools.
