# Best Practice - Schedules

## What is an Adobe Workfront “best practice”? 

Best practices are guidelines that represent an effective, efficient course of action; are easily adopted by you and the users at your company; and can be replicated successfully across your organization. 

As you review these recommendations, please keep in mind that some Workfront best practices are universal while others might be more specific to the topic. Use these best practices as a framework to help guide your Workfront system setups and use.

## Navigating this page 

As you scroll through this page, first you’ll find a high-level list of all the best practices for the topic. This allows you to review the recommendations without diving into the details of “why.” 

The “Why are these best practices?” area, found after the high-level list, provides greater detail into some of the best practices and why they're deemed as a process, tool, etc., you should consider implementing with your Workfront instance.

## Schedules best practices 

* Limit the number of schedules you create in Adobe Workfront. 

* The total working hours in each working day on the schedule should be equal to the number of hours in a day that is specified in the global project preferences. 

* Add a reminder to the Adobe Workfront system administrator’s calendar to update Schedules at a set time each year.

## Why are these best practices? 

**Best practice**

Limit the number of schedules you create in Adobe Workfront. 

  

**Here’s why**

Don’t create dozens of schedules for different groups, teams, or individuals. Fewer schedules means less maintenance by the system or group administrators. 

 

Separate schedules might be needed when: 

* Employees are in different time zones (U.S. Pacific vs. U.S. Eastern) or different regions (EMEA vs. APAC). 

* You have part-time workers who work less than 40 hours per week. 

* Workers don’t work the standard 8 hours a day, Monday-Friday, such as weekend workers or those who work four 10-hour days.

**Best practice** 

The total working hours in each working day on the schedule should be equal to the number of hours in a day that is specified in the global project preferences. 



**Here’s why**

If the total working hours don’t match, this can result in seemingly incorrect date and time calculations in your project timeline and reports. 

For example, if the system preference is eight hours in a day and the schedule assigned to a project has only seven working hours a day, you’ll notice that a task with a one-day duration takes more than one day to complete, because it’s trying to fit in the eight hours. 

**Note**: The system global project settings are done in Setup > Project Preferences > Timeline Calculations > Typical hours per work day.

**Best practice**

Add a reminder to the Adobe Workfront system administrator’s calendar to update Schedules at a set time each year. 

**Here’s why**

Update the schedules in your Workfront instance with national holidays, company holidays, and other days users won’t be working. Do this at a set time each year, either at the end of the year or when holiday schedules are released by human resources, so project timelines, resource planning, etc., reflect accurate user availability.
