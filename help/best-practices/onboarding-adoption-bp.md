# Best Practice - Onboarding and adoption

## What is an Adobe Workfront “best practice”? 

Best practices are guidelines that represent an effective, efficient course of action; are easily adopted by you and the users at your company; and can be replicated successfully across your organization. 

As you review these recommendations, please keep in mind that some Workfront best practices are universal while others might be more specific to the topic. Use these best practices as a framework to help guide your Workfront system setups and use.

## Navigating this page 

As you scroll through this page, first you’ll find a high-level list of all the best practices for the topic. This allows you to review the recommendations without diving into the details of “why.” 

The “Why are these best practices?” area, found after the high-level list, provides greater detail into some of the best practices and why they're deemed as a process, tool, etc., you should consider implementing with your Workfront instance.

## Onboarding and adoption best practices 

* Make sure to spend at least 1 hour per month communicating the “Why?” when a new process or software, such as Adobe Workfront, is implemented. 

* Before creating training videos or guides, review what is available on Workfront One. 

* Set aside time, right from the start, for regular training sessions for both new and existing users to help them continue expanding their knowledge of Workfront. 

* Define and create the framework for a Workfront governance board and secure resources needed for that board. 

* Start with a basic process and go through it slowly to boost user adoption. Don’t try to make the system or new process everything to everyone. 

* Use your process diagrams to support conversations in cases where adoption is struggling. 

* Establish a Workfront Center of Excellence to inform company best practices with Workfront. 

* Use the Workfront One Community. 

* Set standards or expectations for users and make sure leadership supports those expectations.

## Why are these best practices? 

**Best practice**

Make sure to spend at least 1 hour per month communicating the “Why?” when a new process or software, such as Adobe Workfront, is implemented.

**Here’s why**

Messaging should be kept simple and should go out on a regular cadence. Make sure it communicates to users, teams, and departments what the goals and expected outcomes for implementing Workfront are, how individuals will benefit, and why it’s important to not just you but the organization as a whole.  

These communication efforts create awareness among users and provide the framework for a plan to connect work back to strategy. Ensuring shared understanding across the team about how Workfront supports the overall vision and mission of the organization is critical to success.

</br>

**Best practice**

Before creating training videos or guides, review what is available on Workfront One. 

**Here’s why**
 
If you don’t have to create training for your users about Workfront, don’t. You can, of course, create your own training, but if you don’t have the time to do it yourself or the money to purchase custom training, there are really good resources on the Training page on Workfront One to get your users up and running, no matter their role  

In addition, check out the Getting Started page for the basic courses to get users up and running on Workfront. 

</br>
</br>

**Best practice**

Define and create the framework for a Workfront governance board and secure resources needed for that board. 

**Here’s why**

Because so many teams contribute to the overall success of your organization, there need to be certain standards that everyone follows to ensure operational excellence. This is done by the governance board—all of whom have a voice at the table, understand the strategic initiatives of the company, and can participate in working toward common goals. 

More often than not, the board will consist of:  

* System administrators 
* Group administrators 
* Champions 
* Power users 
 

Each user should be assigned a role and given responsibilities that help oversee key infrastructure practices like communication, education, process improvement, or reporting.   

For more information, go to the System Administrator Best Practices – Knowing Your People page on Workfront One.

**Best practice**

Use your process diagrams to support conversations in cases where adoption is struggling.

**Here’s why**

Sharing process diagrams with your people managers and users gives them a behind-the-scenes look at why things were built the way they were in Workfront. This creates a good baseline understanding of why some tools are used in specific ways and why some tools aren’t being used yet. 

In addition, users can understand how the work they do is captured and measured in Workfront and how management can then recognize how the work benefitted the company and its success.

</br>
</br>

**Best practice**

Establish a Workfront Center of Excellence to inform company best practices with Workfront. 

**Here’s why**

The Workfront Center of Excellence is composed of your subject matter experts (SMEs) who help define your organizational best practices and help support teams in understanding what those best practices are and why. 

</br>
</br>

**Best practice**

Use the Workfront One Community. 

**Here’s why**

Workfront One’s Community is a chance for you to ask for and receive advice on all things Workfront and work related. Even if you don’t want to participate in the discussions, you can peruse the page to find information on topics you're interested in or struggle with. 

</br>
</br>


**Best practice**

Set standards or expectations for users and make sure leadership supports those expectations.

**Here’s why**

It’s important that users are given clear expectations so they know what the goal is with Workfront and where they stand in meeting those expectations. It is equally important for them to know that leadership is behind those standards. 


Make sure leadership sends out communications stating their support.
