# Best Practice - Utilization

## What is an Adobe Workfront “best practice”? 

Best practices are guidelines that represent an effective, efficient course of action; are easily adopted by you and the users at your company; and can be replicated successfully across your organization. 

As you review these recommendations, please keep in mind that some Workfront best practices are universal while others might be more specific to the topic. Use these best practices as a framework to help guide your Workfront system setups and use.

## Navigating this page 

As you scroll through this page, first you’ll find a high-level list of all the best practices for the topic. This allows you to review the recommendations without diving into the details of “why.” 

The “Why are these best practices?” area, found after the high-level list, provides greater detail into some of the best practices and why they're deemed as a process, tool, etc., you should consider implementing with your Workfront instance.

* Track progress, cost, and revenue with the Utilization report. 

* Assign resources to children tasks rather than to parent tasks to track the total hours logged in utilization reports.

## Why are these best practices? 

**Best practice**

Track progress, cost, and revenue with the Utilization report. 



**Here’s why**

Make the most out of your people resources by analyzing the progress, cost, or revenue of a project, program, or portfolio with the Utilization report. This single report is an essential tool for resource managers, project managers, or other people managers because this can also compare planned or actual revenue against cost so that you can make more insightful decisions and fully gauge the different types and number of resources a specific task or project may require. 



Note: Resource utilization information is found in Workfront Main Menu > Resourcing > Utilization.

**Best practice**

Assign resources to children tasks rather than to parent tasks to track the total hours logged in utilization reports.



**Here’s why**

When the Utilization report is created, it includes hours logged to the project, children tasks, issues, and parent tasks that have at least one assignment. However, it does not track the hours logged to parent tasks without any assignments. To get a good representation of the total hours spent on the tasks, issues, or project, do not use parent tasks as working tasks and assign users only to children tasks.
