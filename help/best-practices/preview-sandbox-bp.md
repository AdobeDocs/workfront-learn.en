# Best Practice - Preview Sandbox

## What is an Adobe Workfront “best practice”? 

Best practices are guidelines that represent an effective, efficient course of action; are easily adopted by you and the users at your company; and can be replicated successfully across your organization. 

As you review these recommendations, please keep in mind that some Workfront best practices are universal while others might be more specific to the topic. Use these best practices as a framework to help guide your Workfront system setups and use.

## Navigating this page 

As you scroll through this page, first you’ll find a high-level list of all the best practices for the topic. This allows you to review the recommendations without diving into the details of “why.” 

The “Why are these best practices?” area, found after the high-level list, provides greater detail into some of the best practices and why they're deemed as a process, tool, etc., you should consider implementing with your Workfront instance.

## Why are these best practices? 

**Best practice**

Define, diagram, and test changes to existing Workfront processes or settings in the Preview Sandbox environment before you make updates in your Production instance.  

**Here’s why**

The Preview Sandbox environment serves as a replica of your live environment. Although it is not recommended to create an entire new environment in the Sandbox before building it out in the Production instance, as this creates extra work, it is good to use it as a testing environment for changes that you would like to implement. 

Conducting user acceptance testing (UAT) and involving select users during the testing phase of a change can help you better understand your users' needs and workflows. This is a great way to improve Workfront workflows and adoption within your organization. 


**Note**: Every change that you would like to implement in Workfront does not have to be created in the Preview Sandbox environment first. Many Workfront changes, like the creation of a new request queue or project template, can be done within the Production environment. A good rule of thumb when testing in the Production instance is to control the visibility of your objects until you're ready to publish to a larger audience. Be sure to delete anything that you don’t intend to use so that the system remains clean and manageable.
