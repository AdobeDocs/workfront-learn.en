# Find and manage requests

In this video you'll learn how to find requests you're assigned to, requests you've created, and requests that you manage.

You will learn how to find these requests in the following places:

* Workfront [!UICONTROL Home]
* The [!UICONTROL Requests] area
* The [!UICONTROL Teams] page
* In a custom dashboard
