## Activity: Create a task report

You want to make sure you are aware of tasks assigned to one of your teams that no one has agreed to work on it yet. Create a task report named “Unassigned Tasks on any of my teams.”  

## Answer

Here is what the filter should look like:

Set up your column view to include the fields you’re interested in or would like to be able to in-line edit. For example, you could include an Assignments column so you could assign a team member to a task directly from the report. 

You might want to group the list based on the name of the team assigned to each task.
