## Sharing a calendar

As a project manager, you may create a calendar that you want to share with others, such as project managers, team members, etc.

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]**, select a **[!UICONTROL Calendars]** area.
1. Select the calendar you want to share.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Sharing]** from the **[!UICONTROL Calendar Actions]** drop-down menu.
1. Enter the name(s) of the users, roles, teams, groups, or companies you want to share the calendar with.
1. Select if the users get [!UICONTROL View] or [!UICONTROL Manage] access to the calendar report.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

As you're sharing calendars, here are a few things to note:

* Click the **[!UICONTROL gear icon]** in the upper-right corner of the Sharing window to make the calendar visible system-wide or to make it public to external users.
* [!UICONTROL View] access allows users to look at the calendar but not change the filters that control the groupings.
* [!UICONTROL Manage] access allows users to look at the calendar and change the filters that control the groupings.

## Shareable link

You can share a calendar with other [!DNL Workfront] users through a private link. This takes them directly to the calendar in [!DNL Workfront]. 

You can do this from the **[!UICONTROL Calendar Actions]** menu, by selecting **[!UICONTROL Get Shareable Link]**. From there, click the **[!UICONTROL Copy Link]** button and paste the URL into an email or instant message with someone else.
