## Activity: Create a basic grouping

Create an issue grouping that will be used in a report to track requests that come through a request queue. This grouping will make it easy to see similar types of issues/requests grouped by their priority. Name the grouping “Request Queue, Queue Topic, Priority.”

Group the issue report based on:

1. The name of the request queue (this will be the project name)
1. The queue topic
1. The priority of the request
