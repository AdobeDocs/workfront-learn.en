## Activity: Create a note report with prompts

Create a Note report that you can use to search for user notes (i.e., comments or updates) or system notes based on the note content, the author, entry date, project name, or audit type. Name the report “Note Search.”

When using the Note Text prompt, this report will search within update threads to quickly extract any that meet the criteria specified in the prompts. When you run the report, you don’t need to fill in every prompt, just the ones you care about. The blank ones are automatically ignored.

The view should include columns for:

* Note Text
* Audit Text
* Entry Date
* Owner: Name
* Audit Type
* Task Name
* Issue Name

Leave the filter tab blank.

Group on Project Name.

Include prompts for the following:

* Audit Text
* Note Text
* Owner Name
* Entry Date
* Project Name
* Audit Type
