# Understand team capacity

The Team capacity chart shows when a home team was over-allocated or under-allocated. The chart displays the volume of work assigned to the home team on a given day and assigns a darker blue color when they are approaching burnout or aren't being challenged. A lighter, more transparent color indicates the workload is more balanced.

Seeing this information helps you determine:

* When the home team was over-allocated or under-allocated.
* If the home team is over-allocated or under-allocated on a daily basis.
* How consistent a home team's workload is from day to day.
* If you're creating capacity issues with new work.

On the chart, you can see:

1. The percentage of the home team's capacity is on the left.
1. Dates across the bottom come from the selected date range.
1. The darker blue fill color indicates the home team is either experiencing burnout (4) or is unchallenged.
1. The lighter or more transparent blue indicates the home team's workload is balanced

## How to navigate to the chart

1. Click on the [!UICONTROL People] tab in the left panel.
1. Use the [!UICONTROL Filter] to choose one or more Home teams to examine.
1. You will see the team capacity chart appear below the [!UICONTROL Resource capacity] chart.

## How to use the chart

To display data on the charts in the People section of the Analytics area, you must add filters and select a date range. If you have added filters before, they are active until you remove them.

On the Team capacity chart, you can:

* Hover over a point on the chart to see the date line.
* Hover over a point on the graphed line to see the scheduled hours and planned hours for the given date, as well as the capacity percentage and whether the home team was over, under, or at capacity at this time.
* Zoom in on dates by clicking and dragging the mouse over a certain point of the project. (This action updates all other charts to zoom in on the same date range.)
* Export the chart data with the export button in the top-right corner of the chart.
