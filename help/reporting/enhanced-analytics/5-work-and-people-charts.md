# Understand work and people charts

Work charts show you activity from the project and task perspective, while the People chart shows you activity from the perspective of a home team.

Select the type of Analytics charts you want to view—Work or People—from the left panel menu.

## Work charts

When you go to the Work charts, you'll see by default: 

1. KPI statistics
1. Flight plan
1. Project activity
1. Project treemap (not shown above)

The Burndown and the Tasks in flight charts appear when you drill down into the data. 

* Click on a project in the Flight plan view and a Burndown view of that project will appear below it. 
* Click on a project in the Treemap view and both a Burndown and a Tasks in flight view will appear below it.

## People chart - Activity by team

1. Purple boxes show that users assigned to the project logged in on that day, with a darker shade indicating a higher number of users logging in.
1. Pink boxes show that users changed the status of a task for the project on that day, with a darker shade indicating a higher number of task statuses changing.
1. Blue boxes show that users completed a task for the project, with a darker shade indicating a higher number of tasks being completed.
