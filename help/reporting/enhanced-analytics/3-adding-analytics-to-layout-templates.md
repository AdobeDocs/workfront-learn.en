# How to access Enhanced analytics

Like most other features in Workfront, you access [!UICONTROL Enhanced analytics] from the main menu. But [!UICONTROL Analytics] is not on the main menu by default.

If you don't see it there, your system or group administrator will need to add it for you. They will do that in a layout template. The video below explains how.

Anyone with a Workfront license (in [!UICONTROL Workfront Business] plans or higher) can access [!UICONTROL Analytics] once it's added to the layout template they're assigned. However, you'll only see the projects and user information if allowed by your Workfront access level and the sharing permissions on specific projects and users.
