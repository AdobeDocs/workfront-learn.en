In this video, you will learn:

Anyone with a Workfront license ([!UICONTROL Work], [!UICONTROL Plan], or [!UICONTROL Collaborator] in [!UICONTROL Workfront Business] plans or higher) can access [!UICONTROL Analytics] once it’s added to the layout template they’re assigned. However, you’ll only see the projects and user information if allowed by your Workfront access level and the sharing permissions on specific projects and users.
