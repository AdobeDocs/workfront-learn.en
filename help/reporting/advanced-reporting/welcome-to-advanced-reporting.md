# Welcome to advanced reporting

Learn how to use the [[!UICONTROL API Explorer]](https://developer.adobe.com/workfront/api-explorer/) and text mode to create advanced filters, views, and groupings that go beyond the capabilities of the [!UICONTROL Reporting UI].

Three tutorials make up Advanced reporting. They are Advanced reporting parts 1, 2, and 3. Together they comprise 5 hours and 33 minutes of training.

In addition to the videos you will want to download the [Advanced reporting manual](/help/assets/advanced-reporting-manual.pdf) for reference and exercises.

**Advanced reporting part 1** contains a review of report creation, an introduction to [!UICONTROL API explorer] and text mode, and an in depth study of text mode filters. 

**Advanced reporting part 2** contains an in depth study of text mode views, additional details about the structure of text mode, calculated custom data, and calculated columns.

**Advanced reporting part 3** contains an in depth study of text mode groupings, calculated aggregates, and calculated groupings.

## Prerequisites

Before watching these tutorials you should have a:

* Good understanding of using Workfront. This means you’ve been a serious Workfront user for at least 3 to 6 months.
* Good understanding of the objects you want to include in reports.
* Good understanding of using custom forms, especially calculated custom fields.
* A [!UICONTROL Plan] license type with rights to create reports and filters enabled.
* You should have taken the [!UICONTROL Basic Reporting Elements] course, the [!UICONTROL Create custom reports and dashboards] course and all the intermediate reporting courses.

## Target audience

The target audience for these tutorials is [!UICONTROL Plan] license users who currently create custom reports and who want to know how to use text mode to do more than the reporting user interface was designed to do.

## Where did these tutorials come from?

These tutorials are recordings of a live class given over a period of three days in February 2018. You may notice an older UI in the videos, but this will not affect the accuracy or relevancy of the content provided.

You will also hear some references to getting a test drive account to practice in. Adobe Experience League does not provide test drive accounts, but don’t worry. You can practice in your production account. After all, reporting is just about viewing objects in Workfront, not about creating or deleting any objects. Except for creating the reports themselves of course. But besides the system administrator, you are the only one who can see the reports you create unless you decide to share them.
