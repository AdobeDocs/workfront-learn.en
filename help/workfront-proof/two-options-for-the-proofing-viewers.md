# Two options for the proofing viewers

[!DNL Workfront] allows you to review two main categories of proofs—static and interactive.

Static proofs are things like PDFs, images, and text files. Some website proofs fall into the interactive proof category, depending on how the proof was uploaded.

[!DNL Workfront] opens the appropriate version of the proofing viewer—the web-based proofing viewer or the desktop proofing viewer—based on the type of proof you’re viewing (and some setups done by your proofing system administrator).

The web-based proofing viewer is [!DNL Workfront’s] default for static proofs and videos. When you click [!UICONTROL Open Proof], either in an email or in [!DNL Workfront] itself, the web-based viewer opens as part of your [!DNL Workfront] browser window.

The desktop proofing viewer is a stand-alone application that runs on your workstation. It is used mainly for interactive website proofs that were created using a URL, embedded or streaming videos, interactive banners, and HTML5 animations. The viewer allows you to click on links and menus that are part of the website and navigate to different pages.

The two viewers work the same, ensuring collaboration on reviews no matter the type of proof. 

## Install the desktop proofing viewer

The first time you open a proof with interactive content, you’re prompted to download the desktop proofing viewer. Just follow the instructions.

If your organization does not allow you to install applications on your workstation, work with your system administrator to ensure you have the proofing viewer you need.

Once the desktop proofing viewer application is installed, your interactive proofs will open into it in the future. You only have to download it once.
