# Set up proof account default settings

Establish default account settings that apply globally to all proofs and proofing users—country, language, and time zone. If you have users across multiple time zones or countries, you can adjust these settings on each individual’s user profile, if needed.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Proofing]** from [!DNL Workfront’s] [!UICONTROL Main Menu].
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Account Settings]** in the top navigation bar.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Details]** tab.
1. Go to [!UICONTROL Country] field and select **[!UICONTROL Edit]**. Choose the country the majority of your proofing users are in as your default.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** for that setting.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Default language] field and select **[!UICONTROL Edit]**. Choose the language the majority of your proofing users will use as the default.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** for that setting.
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Time zone default] field and select **[!UICONTROL Edit]**. Choose the time zone the majority of your proofing users will be in as the default. This will be the time zone recognized by proof workflows that are set up manually. It also will apply to proof workflow templates, but each template can have a time zone set.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** for that setting.
