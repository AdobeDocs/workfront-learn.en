## Your turn

1. Determine what decision options are needed for your organization’s proof workflows. Remember, these settings are global so every team using proofing will see the same options.
1. Now log in to Workfront and go to the proofing settings. In the Decisions tab, rename the decisions to match your organization’s needs. Hide the options that won’t be needed.
1. Once you have the decision settings done, give them a quick test by uploading a proof and assigning yourself as a Review & Approver.
