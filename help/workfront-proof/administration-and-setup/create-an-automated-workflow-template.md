## Additional stage activation options

Two options for determining when a proofing workflow stage should kick off are rarely, if ever, used: the [!UICONTROL Date and time] option and the “[!UICONTROL When the previous stage deadline passes]” option.

The second option really only works in scenarios where you have a large group of people reviewing and you don’t want to wait on all of them. It’s kind of a “I’ll give you a certain amount of time to complete your review and then you lose your chance” option. But even this can slow down a review process.

If you do use “[!UICONTROL when the previous stage deadline passes],” it’s important to remember that you can manually activate a stage at any time if you don’t want to wait for a deadline to pass.
