# Email alert vs. proof notification

Email alerts are different from proof notification emails. You’ll receive a proof notification email when you’ve been assigned a new proof to review, when a proof is late, or when there’s a new version of the proof for you to look at.

If you turn off the notification option when uploading a proof, then no one receives any communication from [!DNL Workfront] about there being a new proof to review.

Email alerts are set per reviewer/approver, most often as the proof is uploaded. A default email alert type may be assigned to your proof recipients so you don’t have to set it each time you upload a proof. Talk to your system administrator about getting these defaults set.

Even if email alerts are set to [!UICONTROL Disabled], proof recipients are still notified of a new proof or version.
