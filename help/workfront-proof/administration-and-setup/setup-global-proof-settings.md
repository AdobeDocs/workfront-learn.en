# Setup global proof settings

Start the system setups for proofing in [!DNL Workfront] by establishing global default settings that affect users. Setting these defaults now ensures the users you create have the minimum setups needed to start using µ∂ proofing capabilities...plus it saves you time as you work through the proofing setups.

* Assign default proof roles
* Establish default account settings
* Set default proof settings

If you already started creating users before you establish these defaults, don’t worry. You can edit all of this information on the individual user profiles.
