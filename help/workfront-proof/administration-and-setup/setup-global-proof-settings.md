# Set up global proof settings

Start the system setups for proofing in [!DNL Workfront] by establishing global default settings that affect users. Setting these defaults now ensures the users you create have the minimum setups needed to start using proofing capabilities...plus it saves you time as you work through the proofing setups.

* Assign default proof roles
* Establish default account settings
* Set default proof settings

If you already started creating users before you establish these defaults, don't worry. You can edit all of this information on the individual user profiles.
