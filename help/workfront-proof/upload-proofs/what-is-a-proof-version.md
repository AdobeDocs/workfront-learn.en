# What is a proof version?

[!DNL Workfront’s] proofing features help your organization manage the review and approval process across multiple iterations of a file using versions.

A basic definition of a version is a revised copy of a proof. For example, the design for your organization’s booth at the user conference has gone through the initial review and approval process using [!DNL Workfront’s] proofing features. Corrections have been made, and the updated file is ready for review.

The new file can be added to [!DNL Workfront] as a version of the original file.

This “stacks” the version on top of the original file, maintaining a history of the revisions while ensuring you’re viewing the latest iteration of the work. [!DNL Workfront’s] proofing viewer also allows you to compare the latest version to an earlier version of the file.

Let’s get started reviewing and comparing proof versions.
