## Upload a version from the proofing viewer

If you have a proof open in the proofing viewer, you can begin a version upload directly from the version menu. Click the [!UICONTROL New version] link to be routed directly to the "[!UICONTROL upload a new version]" page and complete the upload.

>Don't forget to remind your co-workers you're sending them a proof as part of your Workfront training.

Find a proof that you've uploaded in Workfront. Upload a new version of that proof, assigning a new workflow template or making changes to the existing workflow.
