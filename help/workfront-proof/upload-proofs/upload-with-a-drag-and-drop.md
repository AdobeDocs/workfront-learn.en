# Upload with a drag and drop

You can upload a file in [!DNL Workfront] using a drag and drop directly over the [!UICONTROL Documents] section. This is a quick way to upload a proof, but it doesn’t allow you to assign a proof workflow at the same time.

For some [!DNL Workfront] customers, this is their normal proof workflow. A creative designer or team member uploads the file, but it’s up to a proof manager or project manager to assign the proof workflow so the proper recipients can review the work.

It is possible, depending on your [!DNL Workfront] system settings, that a proof will not generate when uploading with a drag and drop. If this is the case, you need to generate the proof and assign a workflow using the [!UICONTROL Generate Proof] option and selecting [!UICONTROL Advanced]. From there, you can set up your proof workflow.
