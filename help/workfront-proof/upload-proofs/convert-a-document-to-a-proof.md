## Who can upload documents?

Your system administrator determines in what format—document or proof—you can upload files into [!DNL Workfront]. Some users may be able to upload only documents, some upload only proofs, or some upload both. Your permissions are based on your role in the proofing workflow.

If you find these settings need to be adjusted, talk with your system administrator.
