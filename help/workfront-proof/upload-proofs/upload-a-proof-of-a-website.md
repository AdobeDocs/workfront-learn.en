## Interactive content considerations

As you start proofing websites, you may find that [!DNL Workfront] doesn’t support every configuration or situation. Certain criteria must be met:

* The website must be hosted with a secure protocol, meaning the website address starts with https.
* The website to be proofed cannot be embedded in an iframe.
* The website must be accessible to the reviewers.
* The website needs to be publicly accessible, meaning it can’t be behind a firewall.
* When creating static website proofs, the website cannot be password protected.
