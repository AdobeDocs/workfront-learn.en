# Create multi-stage proof workflows

Proof workflows can be simple, with just a few reviewers and a single deadline. Or they can be more complicated, with multiple deadlines and people looking at the proof in a specific order.

[!DNL Workfront] has two types of proof workflowsâ€”basic and automated, sometimes called advanced.

An automated workflow has multiple stages, or steps, that need to be completed in a certain order. Each stage has its own set of recipients (reviewers and approvers), in addition to its own deadline.

This tutorial is an incomplete dulplicate. It should have a video included. Video with MPC ID 335130 does an excellent job of explaining automated workflows, but it was in the Workfront Proof > Administration and setup section of the TOC. I moved it, along with related workflow tutorials, into the Workfront Proof > Proof workflows section. I also removed this tutorial from the TOC.
