## Keyword best practices

It is important to outline best practices to guide your keyword efforts. Below are some guidelines.

* Be consistent with acronyms and abbreviations. Don’t keyword one asset with “AZ” and another asset with “Arizona.”
* Be consistent in plural versus singular. Choose one format or always use both. For example, either use “feet” and “hands” or “foot, feet” and “hand, hands.”
* Be consistent in how you describe an action or activity, for instance, either use “running” and “swimming” or “run” and “swim.”
* Don’t be too narrow. “Keokuk, IA” may be too narrow for a keyword and completely unrecognizable to users. “Southeast Iowa” would be better.
* Don’t be too broad. “University” may not work, especially if everything in your system relates to a university. Determine what will distinguish the assets, such as a specific college name.
* Be mindful of relevance. Just because every asset has a project code does not mean it will be useful to users relying on keywords to find assets. If this information needs to stay with the asset, consider adding it in another metadata field.
* Don’t use too few keywords, otherwise they won’t help narrow search results.
* Don’t rely on keywords for every piece of data. Use metadata fields for information such as photographer name or location.

## Keyword strategy

A keyword strategy will help you achieve a high level of consistency and accuracy with the way your assets are tagged.

Have use cases in mind when adding keywords to keep your efforts focused. Fill in this sentence when considering a keyword: “**How likely is it that [insert person/role] will search by [insert keyword] when looking for [insert asset]?**”

Outline what types of keywords should be added to assets. A good rule of thumb with adding keywords is to answer the following basic questions:

* **Who**—Who is the asset targeted for?
* **What**—What is the intended purpose of the asset?
* **Where**—Where was the asset created and/or where can it be used?
* **When**—When was the asset created and/or when it should be used?
* **Why**—Why was it created (for an event, a brochure)?
