# Metadata mapping

[!DNL Workfront]-related information about an asset can be transferred from [!DNL Workfront] into [!UICONTROL Workfront DAM] with the asset. The metadata mapping option in the [!DNL Workfront] [!UICONTROL Setup] area allows for this transfer of information.

Talk to your [!DNL Workfront] consultant for best practice recommendations on setting up the metadata mapping.

You must be a [!DNL Workfront] administrator and a [!UICONTROL Workfront DAM] administrator to set up metadata mapping. Before you can start, you must connect your [!DNL Workfront] and [!UICONTROL Workfront DAM] accounts.
