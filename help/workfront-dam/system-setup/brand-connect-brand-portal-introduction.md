## Asset folders

Folders serve multiple purposes in [!UICONTROL Workfront DAM]. First, they are a means for organizing assets. Second, they are used to grant different groups of users access to the assets within the folders.

Some users will browse through the folders to find assets they want rather than searching. A logical, thought-out folder structure will direct these users to the right place. Some [!UICONTROL Workfront DAM] customers organize folders by department, file type, asset subject, product, event, or workflow. But what works for one organization may not work for another.

Folders are also how users are granted access to assets. Users are organized into groups, and then groups are given permission to access the folders. Permissions on folders may vary by groupâ€”view only, upload assets, download assets, edit assets, etc.

When creating folders and nested folders, keep in mind the groups and users that will need to access the assets within the folders. The structure of groups could affect the way you organize folders; and how folders are organized could affect how groups are created.
