# Introduction to the [!UICONTROL Business Case]

As a manager, it’s your goal to make sure projects contribute to the overall goals and initiatives of the company in a positive way. In order to make informed decisions, you need information from your project managers about what they will need for their projects to move forward. This can be done through the [!UICONTROL Business Case]. 

## What is a [!UICONTROL Business Case]?

Think of a [!UICONTROL Business Case] as a blueprint or proposal for the work that needs to be done. It captures high-level, preliminary estimates that help you plan and manage portfolios. It’s where potential expenses, resources, and risks are entered to build a “case” for why this project would benefit the company. 

## [!UICONTROL Business Case] fields recommended for project prioritization

Each section of the [!UICONTROL Business Case] provides unique and important information about the project. Let’s take a look at the sections that feed information to the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer] tool, which will help you prioritize the projects in your portfolio. 

## [!UICONTROL Project Info] 

Most of the information entered in the [!UICONTROL Project Info] section involves general project details, such as the project sponsor and the program the project belongs to. 

However, there’s one piece of information that could affect the project’s prioritization—[!UICONTROL Planned Benefit].

The [!UICONTROL Planned Benefit] represents the estimated dollar amount your company might benefit from if the project is completed. 

This is one of the sections that could be a tipping point for getting your company to move forward with this project. If you can show the project will contribute significantly to your company’s bottom line, then chances are higher it could be pushed through more quickly. 

## [!UICONTROL Expenses] 

[!UICONTROL Expenses] represent the non-labor costs that may be incurred during the life of a project.

For example, expenses for a user conference could include payment for the venue, items for gift bags, or signs for the venue lobby. 

## [!UICONTROL Resource Budgeting] 

The [!UICONTROL Resource Budgeting] section lets you estimate the labor you think will be needed for the project to move forward. Information is pulled from [!DNL Workfront’s] [!UICONTROL Resource Planner].

By entering estimated needs for each job role, this creates a possible budget needed for the project and gives insight into how much of the portfolio’s budget may be used for the project.

## [!UICONTROL Risks]

You always have the highest of hopes that your project will run smoothly. But it’s important to identify risks and plan for them accordingly. That’s where the [!UICONTROL Risks] section in the [!UICONTROL Business Case] can help.

You can brainstorm and list any difficulties you might run into during the life of the project that could cause the project to run late or incur more costs. It also gives you a chance to plan ahead for what you’ll do if these risks do occur. 

## [!UICONTROL Scorecards] 

[!UICONTROL Scorecards] help determine how well a proposed project aligns with the overall goals and initiatives set for either the portfolio or the company. 

Each scorecard has a list of questions and answers that have values attached to them. When the scorecard is filled out, [!DNL Workfront] can calculate how aligned the project is with your organization’s predetermined goals.

>Project managers won’t be able to see the values assigned to each answer. Only users who create the scorecards can see the values. 

## [!UICONTROL Business Case] not required

The [!UICONTROL Business Case] is flexible. You can fill out just a few sections or none at all. None of the fields are required. However, the more information you fill out, the easier it is to analyze and prioritize projects vying for the same budget or resources. It's important to note that the project information, costs, alignment, and risks sections of the business case must be filled out to work with the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer]. 

Once the [!UICONTROL Business Case] is filled out, click the **[!UICONTROL Submit]** button in the summary panel on the right side of the window. Now you’re ready to prioritize projects. 

>[!NOTE]

>The alignment score in the [!UICONTROL Business Case] summary panel is generated after you fill out the scorecard. The alignment score is one of the values used in calculating the [!UICONTROL Portfolio Optimizer] score.
