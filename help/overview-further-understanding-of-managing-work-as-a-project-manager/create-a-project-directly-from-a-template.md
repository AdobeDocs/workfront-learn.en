If you happen to be working on a template and need to create a project using that template, click the 3-dot menu next to the template name. Then select Create Project.

The details window allows you to make changes to the settings of the new project.

>[!NOTE]
>
>In order to create a project using this method, you need access to the Templates area of Workfront. If you are unable to access templates, you can still use a template to create a project from the Projects area or when converting an issue/task. 

>[!TIP]
>
>If there's a template you use frequently, make it a favorite! You'll see the template listed in the New Project menu, in addition to it appearing under the Favorites menu in the navigation bar.
