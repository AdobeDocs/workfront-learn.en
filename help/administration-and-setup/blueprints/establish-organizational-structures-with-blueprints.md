# Establish organizational structures with Blueprints

Adobe Workfront administrators can use Blueprints to help build out organizational structures in Workfront. This feature, located in the Main Menu, allows you to streamline the creation of companies, groups, roles, and teams in your environment.

To install an organizational structure blueprint in your production or sandbox environments, select Blueprints in the Main Menu. Browse through the catalog or use the Filter by type option found in the filtering menu on the right to locate and install the proper blueprint. 

Before installing, map the company, group, job role, and team fields according to the needs of your organization. Fields will vary depending on the blueprint selected. 

<!--Note: There are two types of Blueprintsâ€”Project Template and Organizational Structure. For more information on using blueprints and steps you need to take following installation, refer to the Blueprints articles.-->
