# Set up automatic reminders

Automatic reminders are similar to reminder notifications except that they apply to every object, they are sent to everyone assigned to those work items, and the message cannot be customized. 

They can be sent to one or more of the following:

* The user assigned to a task or issue.
* The userâ€™s immediate manager.
* The manager of the immediate manager.
 
Although not commonly used, automatic reminders can be useful if your organization has an issue with and wants to hold users accountable for completing work on time. 

Automatic reminders can be set up in the [!UICONTROL Email] section of the [!UICONTROL Setup] area. You will just need to determine:

* Who needs to get the automatic reminder.
* How much time before/after the work is due should the notification be sent.

At this point the automatic reminders have been applied and will be sent out as soon as the criteria are met. In addition, users cannot disable automatic reminders in their [!UICONTROL My Settings] window.
