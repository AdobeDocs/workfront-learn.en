## Team creation

Teams also can be created and settings established through the [!UICONTROL Teams] area of [!DNL Workfront].

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Teams]** from the **[!UICONTROL Main Menu]**.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Create Team]**.
1. Give the team a name.
1. Indicate if the team is an Agile team by turning on the toggle.
1. Associate the team with a [!DNL Workfront] group, if desired.
1. Add the team members.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create]**.

Once the team is created, edit the settings by selecting the team from the list and clicking [!UICONTROL Team Settings] on the right side of the window.

Adjust the settings, such as assigning a layout template, or add more team members. In addition, you can customize the [!UICONTROL Work On It] button and the Done button this team will see on their task and issue work assignments.

By default, the [!UICONTROL Work On It] button simply tells [!DNL Workfront] you’ll work on the task without changing the status of the task to In Progress (or an equivalent status). To have [!DNL Workfront] automatically change the status, change the [!UICONTROL Work On It] button to a [!UICONTROL Start] button. Just check the box in the team settings.

When the [!UICONTROL Start] button is clicked, the status of the task or issue changes from New the one selected in the team settings. [!DNL Workfront] also logs an actual start date for the task.

Be sure to save any changes when you’re done.
