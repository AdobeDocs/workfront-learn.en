## Set list defaults

Setting default filters, views, and/or groupings for users gives them quicker access to vital information that can move work forward, faster. 

As a system or group administrator, you can determine what users initially see when looking at a list of projects, tasks, issues, etc., by setting a default filter, view, and/or grouping through a layout template.

>[!NOTE]

>Although a default filter, view, and/or grouping can be set up, the system is sticky and will show whatever filter, view, and/or grouping was last used by the user.


If you want to set a list default, you can either:

* Hover your mouse over an option already listed and click [!UICONTROL Set as default].

* Or add a custom filter, view, or grouping and check the box next to [!UICONTROL Set default].

Once done, youâ€™ll see the [!UICONTROL Default] tag.
