# Use [!UICONTROL Work Effort] in project planning

[!DNL Workfront] understands that some organizations don’t use planned hours when creating projects. However, to get the full benefits of [!DNL Workfront's] resource management tools and a better understanding of the amount of work users are assigned, planned hours in projects is a must.

With both concepts in mind, [!DNL Workfront] created the [!UICONTROL Work Effort] option.

Instead of entering specific hours for each task in the project, use the [!UICONTROL Work Effort] to determine if a task is a small, medium, or large effort. [!DNL Workfront] automatically associates planned hours with those tasks.

That way, if you plan on using any of [!DNL Workfront’s] resource management tools, the numbers you need are already filled in and users have a heads up on the amount of work coming their way.
