There are several ways to create tasks on a project in [!DNL Workfront]. The [!UICONTROL Insert Task Above]/[!UICONTROL Insert Task Below] options (which are detailed in the "Work with tasks in a project" video tutorial) allow you to add tasks exactly where you need them. But you may find another method works better for you.

1.Creating a new task with the [!DNL New Task] button opens an abbreviated form for quick task creation. From this [!UICONTROL New Task] box, you can fill in all the essential pieces of information — [!UICONTROL Task Name], [!UICONTROL Description], [!UICONTROL Assignments], [!UICONTROL Duration], and [!UICONTROL Planned Completion Date]. If your organization requires additional information, click the [!UICONTROL More Options] button to launch the [!UICONTROL Create Task] window for a comprehensive task creation form.

Both of these options place the task at the bottom of the plan at the “parent” task level, or the main task level. Then you can move the task to its proper position in the plan.

2.[!UICONTROL Add More Tasks] creates a new task line at the bottom of the project, so you can use the inline editing to fill in the information. This task inherits the positioning of the task immediately above it.

3.[!UICONTROL Copy To] and [!UICONTROL Move To] from the [!UICONTROL More] menu let you copy or move tasks to another project. This is handy if you know there are tasks that exist in another project that you’d like to duplicate in your project.
