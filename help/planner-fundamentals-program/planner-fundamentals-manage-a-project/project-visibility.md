# Share a project

Providing stakeholder and collaborator visibility into the project is an important part of managing a project.

Make sure everyone can see the information they need by sharing the project. In Workfront, this is done with the [!UICONTROL Share] option. You can do this from the individual project, from the [!UICONTROL More] menu in the header.

Or you can share multiple projects at once from the list of projects on the [!UICONTROL Projects] page by selecting the projects and clicking the [!UICONTROL Share] button.

Sharing the project allows everyone involved to see project information when they need it.
