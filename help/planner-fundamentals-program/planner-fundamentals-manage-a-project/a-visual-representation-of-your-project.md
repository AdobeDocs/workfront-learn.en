# Gantt chart: A visual representation of your project

Sometimes, just looking at the task doesn’t give you a good idea of how everything is linked together. Some project managers need to see the information in chart format. If that’s your preference, [!DNL Workfront] recommends the [!UICONTROL Gantt] chart to give you a visual sense of the entire timeline of your project.

The [!UICONTROL Gantt] puts key information into a simple visual to see your plan at a glance. Quickly expose predecessors, milestones, and progress status. Experiment with turning off and on different options.

Then you can see if you forgot to put a predecessor on a new task. You also check the duration and start/due dates, to make sure nothing is out of sequence. View the percent complete so you can spot tasks that are in trouble. And the [!UICONTROL Gantt] can highlight your milestone tasks, letting you know if the project is achieving its goals.
