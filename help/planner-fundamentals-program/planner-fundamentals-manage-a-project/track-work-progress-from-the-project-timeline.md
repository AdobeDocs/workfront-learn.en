# Track progress from the project timeline

Make sure tasks are progressing the way they should to hit project deadlines. As you scan through the [!UICONTROL Task] list, there are several features in [!DNL Adobe Workfront] that help you monitor the progress and status of work.

## Percent complete

The percent complete on each task is sometimes used to gauge how work is progressing. It’s important to note...this field has to be adjusted manually, as it’s the assignee’s estimation of how far along they are.

There are two times when the percent complete changes automatically:

When the task [!UICONTROL Status] is set to Complete, the percent complete changes to 100.
If the task [!UICONTROL Status] rolls back to New, the percent complete is reset to 0.

## Status

Include the [!UICONTROL Status] column in a [!UICONTROL View] to quickly see which tasks have been started, which are in progress, and which are complete. You can even set up conditional formatting in a [!UICONTROL View] to color code each status, making the information easier to decipher.

## Task assignments

As you review the project, review the task assignments. Maybe work fell behind because no one was assigned to the task. Or maybe the person assigned didn’t have the right skill set to complete the work. Add more people to a task or reassign tasks to ensure work gets done.

## Task constraint

Sometimes task constraints get changed and you don’t realize it. Constraints can affect how your timeline behaves, so you might want to check they’re set how you want them.

Create a custom view that includes the [!UICONTROL Task Constraint] column to see this information on your task list. If you planned the project from a start date, you want your tasks to have the [!UICONTROL As Soon As Possible] ([!UICONTROL ASAP]) constraint.
