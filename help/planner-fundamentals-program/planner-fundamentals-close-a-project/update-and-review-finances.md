# Review finances

If your organization uses [!DNL Workfront] to keep track of project-related financial information, reviewing expenses and creating billing records may be part of your process for closing out a project.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Many [!DNL Workfront] customers handle their expenses and project financials in a third-party system, rather than in [!DNL Workfront]. So you may have different processes or guidelines for updating and reviewing financial information before you close out a project.


## Expenses

Expenses can be logged on individual tasks or the project itself. Regardless of what item the expense is logged on, you can view all expenses in the [!UICONTROL Expenses] section of the project itself.

## Billing records

Billing records are used in [!DNL Workfront] to gather billable hours, billable expenses, billable revenues, and additional billable amounts into a single record and amount. Oftentimes, these are exported from [!DNL Workfront] into a third-party invoicing or accounting system.

You must have access to financial data in [!DNL Workfront] in order to create and view billing records.

## Financial details

A glance at the [!UICONTROL Finance] information in the [!UICONTROL Project Details] lets you see actual numbers for benefit, revenue, and cost.

Most of the financial information in the [!UICONTROL Project Details] is set up during the creation of the project, and the numbers you see here are based on that information. So as you’re closing a project, there really isn’t anything you need to update or add in the financial details.
