# Close tasks and issues before closing a project

One of the first steps in closing out a [!DNL Workfront] project is making sure all of the tasks and issues have a status of Complete, or a status that’s an equivalent.

Start with the task list and select a [!UICONTROL View] that displays the [!UICONTROL Percent Complete] or the [!UICONTROL Status] column or both. A quick scan down the task list lets you pinpoint which tasks haven’t had a status change.

Not every organization uses [!DNL Workfront’s] issues functionality to record or resolve problems, change orders, etc., that arose during the project. But if you do, switch over to the [!UICONTROL Issues] section and make sure that all issues have been resolved.
