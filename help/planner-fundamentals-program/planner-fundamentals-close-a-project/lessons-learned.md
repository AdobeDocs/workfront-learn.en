# Record lessons learned

As part of closing a project, some Workfront customers include a “lessons learned” task. This task could be used in different ways.

* Use a “lessons learned” task to represent a meeting. Capture meeting notes in the task updates.
* Or attach a custom form to the task or project to capture the “lessons learned” information that you need.

An advantage of the custom form — all of its fields are reportable, so you can build custom [!DNL Workfront] reports to review and manage this information, identifying lessons learned across many project types or sets.  

If your organization has a more complex post-project process — one that has enough steps to qualify as a project itself — it might be best to create a separate project in [!DNL Workfront].

With this method, you can close out of the project used for the actual deliverable, which keeps your completed project reporting more accurate. Then use a separate post-project project to track any steps that come after.

Talk with your internal [!DNL Workfront] team to learn more about your organization’s post-project process.
