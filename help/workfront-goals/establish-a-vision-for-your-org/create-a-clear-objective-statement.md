## Formulate your Commander's Intent

The purpose of this step is to state the objective or the desired end goal. By creating a clear statement that sets the strategic pillars of your vision you will establish goals your teams can align to. As a leader, write a statement that expresses the end goal and its desired outcome.

This statement is a non-technical deliverable, meaning that it is done as a behavioral best practice outside of the context of the software. It serves as an expression of your vision, as a leader, to your people and teams. This statement should outline the top-level goals as they fit within the vision.

There are four parts to this statement. Addressing each part independently helps make the Commander's Intent clear and direct.

**Part 1: A clear outcome of achieving our purpose looks like…**
Completing this phrase provides the highest level of guidance to your people and teams. This statement will be more focused than your mission and vision statements but likely shares some common tones. Describe what success looks like for your team.

**Part 2: The single most important thing this team can do is...**
Completing this phrase is the foundation of prioritization. It sets clear expectations that, when it all comes down to it, there is a single most important thing to deliver. This deliverable is more than likely the culmination of achievement across many goals (such as launching a new product, rebranding your company, entering a new market, etc.).

**Part 3: The team will accomplish their objective by...**
When you complete this phrase, you really begin to set your strategic pillars. These are likely to be the core top-level goals that must be achieved in order to drive the ultimate outcome.

**Part 4: Our operational constraints include…**
Completing this statement indicates the key indicators of success, how you will measure your progress, and what results must be attained to consider successful achievement. Define what challenges and risks your team should take into consideration. Identifying these constraints will help you decide if the goal is a go or no go.
