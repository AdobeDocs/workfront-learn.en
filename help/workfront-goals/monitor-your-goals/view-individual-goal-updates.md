## Filter information in your Pulse stream

You may notice that sometimes you get too much information in the [!UICONTROL Pulse] stream or maybe not the right information. Filter the information in your feed to see just what you want or need.

1. Click [!UICONTROL **Pulse**] in the left panel.
1. Click the [!UICONTROL **Filter**] icon in the upper-right corner.
1. Select an option to filter by. The All filter is applied by default and displays all goals in your system. You can do one of the following:

   * Select any of the predefined filters—listed under the [!UICONTROL Saved] section of the filters panel—to display goals for owners (i.e., [!UICONTROL All], [!UICONTROL Personal], [!UICONTROL My teams], [!UICONTROL My groups], and [!UICONTROL Company]). 
   * Hover over the name of a filter, then click the **Edit** icon next to its name to customize it and add specific names of users, teams, groups, or the name of your organization.
   * Click [!UICONTROL **New Filter**] to create a new filter, then select from the list of options to customize and filter by [!UICONTROL Period], [!UICONTROL Status], [!UICONTROL Progress], and/or [!UICONTROL Owner].

**Note:** Your filtering selection is preserved and the information in other sections of [!DNL Goals] displays according to this information. You can locate and filter for goals in various sections of the [!DNL Goals] area in [!DNL Workfront]:

* [!UICONTROL Goal List]
* [!UICONTROL Graphs]
* [!UICONTROL Pulse]
* [!UICONTROL Goal Alignment]. In this section, you can temporarily display the goals that do not match the filter you applied so you can get the full picture of all aligned goals. Click the [!UICONTROL **Show it/Show them**] option if there are goals hidden by the selected filter.
