# Manually connect goals to one another

The first way to align goals in [!DNL Workfront Goals] is a bottom-to-top approach. This takes a child goal and connects it to a parent goal. This is particularly useful for individual contributors who have personal goals they want to align to the team's goals. Having this ability allows for individual contributors to see how their work aligns and fits into the bigger work in the organization. It also provides visibility for leadership to see the progression of individual work and a team's work in relation to the overall company strategy.

There are some time restrictions when aligning goals:

* You can align goals that only belong to the same period of time or to a future period of time.
* The child goal must end earlier than or on the same day as the parent goal.
* You cannot align to a goal in the past.
* You can align a quarterly goal to an annual goal but not an annual goal to a quarterly goal.
