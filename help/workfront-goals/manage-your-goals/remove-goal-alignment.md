# Remove goal alignment

What happens when the alignment between goals no longer makes sense? You can remove the goal alignment.

1. Go to a parent goal aligned to a child goal.
1. Click to open the [!UICONTROL Progress indicators] panel.
1. Click the checkbox next to the child goal you want to disconnect from the parent goal.
1. Click the 'X' icon next to the pencil icon.

The goal becomes a stand-alone goal and its progress no longer influences the progress of the original parent goal. Don't forget to add activities or results to the goals to measure progress and move it to an Active status.
