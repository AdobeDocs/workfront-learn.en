## Create a goal from scratch

## Copy an existing goal

Let's say it's the end of a quarter and you want to recreate an existing goal for the next period. Or maybe you didn't complete the goal and need to extend into the next time period. What is the best option to create that goal? You'll want to copy and modify an existing goal.

Copying an existing goal also is useful if multiple team members have similar goals and you need to create one goal for each of them.

Here are a few things to consider before copying goals:

* All of the information from the original goal will be copied, with the exception of the goal period.
* You can copy results of an existing goal and they will transfer to the new goal.
* Copied results are assigned to the same owner, by default.
* You cannot copy progress of the existing goal to a new goal.
* You cannot copy the activities of a goal when you copy a goal.

### How to copy a goal

1. Click a goal name to open the **[!UICONTROL Goal Details]** panel.
1. Click the 3-dot icon next to the goal name, then select **[!UICONTROL Copy]**.
1. Update any of the following information for the copied goal:
    * **Goal name**—This is the name of the new goal. The default is "Copy of" followed by the name of the original goal.
    * **Period**—The time period during which you want to achieve the goal. Select a time period from the drop-down menu or click Define custom dates to indicate a custom time period. The default period is always the current quarter.
    * **Owner**—The owner of the goal. This can be a user, team, group, or company. The default is the owner of the original goal.
    * **Description**—Additional information about the goal.

1. Check the **[!UICONTROL Copy results]** box if the original goal had results added to it and you want to copy them to the new goal. The results of the copied goal have the same owner, names, and measured values as the results of the original goal.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Copy goal]**. The copied goal is saved with a status of Draft.

1. Click the 3-dot icon, then select  **[!UICONTROL Activate]**, which updates the goal status to Active. The goal must have an associated activity or result in order to "activate."

If you copied a goal that was not completed in a previous time period and want to continue working on it in the following time period, do the following:

1. Go to the original goal in the **[!UICONTROL Goal List]**.
1. Add an update to the goal to indicate it was copied and a more current goal was created.
1. Close the original goal to preserve the progress made during its original time period. Click the 3-dot icon next to the goal name and select **[!UICONTROL Close]** from the menu.
1. Update the [!UICONTROL Initial] value of the new result to match the **[!UICONTROL Target]** value of the previous result, so your new goal progress starts calculating from the point achieved in the previous period.

## Convert a result or activity to a goal

The final option for creating goals in [!DNL Workfront Goals] is by converting the results and/or activities of an existing goal into another goal. The converted result/activity becomes a child goal to the original goal.

You might do this when a result/activity is larger in scope than anticipated and it would be beneficial to convert the result/activity into an actual goal itself. Think of this as a bottom-to-top approach of aligning goals.

Here are some things to keep in mind before you convert a result or activity into a goal:

* The converted result or activity becomes the child goal of the original goal, and the two goals become aligned.
* The newly created goal becomes the single progress indicator for the original goal, if there are no additional results or activities on the original goal. You must add results and activities to the child goal to be able to track progress on it.
* Converting a result or activity to a goal is irreversible. Once converted, the new child goal can never become a result or activity for the parent goal again.

In this video, you will learn how to:

* Add an activity and convert it to an aligned goal
