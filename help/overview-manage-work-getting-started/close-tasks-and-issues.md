# Close tasks and issues

One of the first steps in closing out a [!DNL Workfront] project is making sure all of the tasks and issues have a status of Complete, or a status that's an equivalent.

If the [!UICONTROL Percent Complete] field in the project header shows 100% you know that all your tasks are marked as 100% complete. However, a task that is [!UICONTROL Complete - Pending Approval] will still read as 100%, so don't forget to check for those. See [Complete approvals](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront-learn/tutorials-workfront/manage-work/close-a-project/complete-approvals.html) for all the tips about approvals.

If you have any issues that are incomplete, even those pending approval, there will be a number next to the Issues tab showing how many. If the number is zero you don't have any incomplete issues.
