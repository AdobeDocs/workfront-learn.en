# Publishing a scenario

Once youâ€™ve determined which scenario best fits the needs of your organization and its goals, you can turn that plan in the [!DNL Workfront] [!DNL Scenario Planner] into deliverable work, or projects, in [!DNL Workfront]. 

Simply hover your mouse over a scenario card and select the [!UICONTROL Go to Publish] button that appears. From the [!UICONTROL Publish initiatives] page, select any of the initiatives you want to publish as a project and then click the [!UICONTROL Publish initiatives] button at the bottom. 

Those initiatives are now converted to projects that you can find in the [!UICONTROL Projects] area under their original initiative names. Those initiatives are now working projects that can be modified and made active as needed. A new [!DNL Scenario Planner] area displays in the [!UICONTROL Project Details] section that contains information about the job roles of the initiative that generated the project and its duration.
