## Estimate job role information for a plan

When creating a plan, you can establish whether the job role effort should be estimated in FTEs or hours. The system default is FTE but that can be switched when creating a plan.

After the plan is created, all numbers added for job roles in the plan, the planâ€™s scenarios, and any initiatives are entered and displayed in the format selected. That format is displayed at the top of columns requiring job role information.
