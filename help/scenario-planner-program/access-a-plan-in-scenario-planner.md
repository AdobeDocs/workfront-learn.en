# Access a plan in the [!DNL Scenario Planner] 

Just like a with projects in [!DNL Workfront], even if a user has been given permission in an access level to view or manage a plan in [!DNL Workfront] [!DNL Scenario Planner], that does not mean they can view or manage every plan built in the system. That capability relies on whether the plan creator has shared the plan with them and given them permission to view or manage the specific plan.  

The big difference with plans is that system administrators do not have the ability to see all plans created in Workfront. Those will need to be shared with them as well.
