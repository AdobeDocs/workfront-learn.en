# Set up task revenue & cost defaults

The revenue type and cost type are used to calculate the planned and actual financial information for a task. Default information for each of these can be set system-wide, so it applies to each new task created. The information can be changed on individual projects or set on project templates.

**Five default revenue types are available:**

* Not Billable
* User Hourly
* Role Hourly
* Fixed Hourly
* Fixed Revenue

**And four default cost types are available:**

* No Cost
* Fixed Hourly
* User Hourly
* Role Hourly

>[!NOTE]
>
>When the revenue or cost types are set to Not Billable or No Cost, then revenue and cost estimates are not generated for the task. Therefore, work on the task does not contribute to project-level revenue or costs.

## Set revenue and cost defaults

Select **[!UICONTROL Setup]** from the main menu.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Project Preferences]** in the left panel menu.
1. Then click **[!UICONTROL Tasks & Issues]**.
1. In the [!UICONTROL New Task Default] section, select the desired [!UICONTROL Revenue Type] and [!UICONTROL Cost Type].
