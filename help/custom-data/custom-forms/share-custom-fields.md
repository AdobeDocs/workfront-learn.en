# Share custom fields

By default, a custom field in [!DNL Workfront] is editable by everyone who has a Plan license with rights to edit custom forms. You can limit these permissions and determine whether users can manage or only view the custom field. 

By default, a new custom field has edit permissions, meaning users can see the field and edit its value. But if you donâ€™t want it to be edited or deleted by others, change the permissions on the field.

1. Click on **[!UICONTROL Share field]**.
1. Change [!UICONTROL Editable System-Wide] to [!UICONTROL Make this visible system-wide] by clicking the **settings icon**.

If you want specific users, teams, roles, groups, or companies to be able to edit or delete the field in the custom form builder, give them manage rights.

All custom fields are created with default sharing of [!UICONTROL Editable System-Wide]. You can bulk edit sharing to remove or change this option in the [!UICONTROL Fields] tab of the [!UICONTROL Custom Forms] section in the [!UICONTROL Setup] area.
