# Text expressions

Text expressions search, dissect, and combine information found in Workfront to create more meaningful data or gain greater insight into the work being done for your organization. 

For example, text expressions can be used to:

* Show "Over $5,000" when project expenses are more than $5,000, or “Under $5,000” when expenses are below that, in a column of a project view.

* Give each project a unique number that includes the year the project was created, the project's Workfront reference number, the project name, and the project owner's initials.

* Build a report that lists every project that isn't assigned to a portfolio and/or program so you can use this in your manager meetings.

Text expressions can be used in a custom field to do these types of searches and combinations in Workfront.
