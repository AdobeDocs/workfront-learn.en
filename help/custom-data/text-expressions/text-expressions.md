# Text expressions

Text expressions search, dissect, and combine information found in [!DNL Workfront] to create more meaningful data or gain greater insight into the work being done for your organization. 

For example, text expressions can be used to:

* Show "Over $5,000" when project expenses are more than $5,000, or “Under $5,000” when expenses are below that, in a column of a project view.

* Give each project a unique number that includes the year the project was created, the project's  [!DNL Workfront] reference number, the project name, and the project owner's initials.

* Build a report that lists every project that isn't assigned to a portfolio and/or program so you can use this in your manager meetings.

Text expressions can be used in a custom field to do these types of searches and combinations in [!DNL Workfront].
