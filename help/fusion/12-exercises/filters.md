Learn how to use the filter between modules to allow only certain types of bundles through.

## Exercise overview

Add a filter between the two modules in the Beyond basic mapping scenario to only create projects that have a "Red" project color in the CSV file.

## Steps to follow

1. Create a clone of the "Beyond basic mapping" scenario and name it "Using the mighty filter."

    **Add a filter before the Create Workfront projects module to only allow red projects to be created.**

1. Click OK.

    **Test the filter and verify the results.**
