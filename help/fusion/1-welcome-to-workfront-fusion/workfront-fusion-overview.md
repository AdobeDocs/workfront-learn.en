# Workfront Fusion training overview

Each Workfront Fusion section contains multiple tutorials, with each tutorial presenting concepts you’ll need to understand before progressing to the next tutorial. A walkthrough exercise helps you master most concepts. 

The videos show you, step-by-step, how to complete each exercise, which results in creating a new Workfront Fusion scenario. Then you can complete the exercise in your own Workfront Fusion environment, adding to your own collection of scenarios. The **Adobe Workfront Fusion activity book** contains step-by-step instructions for completing the walkthroughs.

In some tutorials, you’ll create a new scenario from scratch. In other sections, you will start by making a copy of a scenario you created previously. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Be sure to complete each tutorial in sequence so you have the right scenarios available when you need to make a copy.

## Training resources and accessing Workfront Fusion

### Request a Workfront test drive

To complete the exercises in the Workfront Fusion learning paths, you will need a Workfront test drive. If you already have a test drive, we recommend a new one for this training.

Request a practice environment by filling out [this form](https://forms.office.com/r/f1J8HRGrNY). If you’re unable to access the form, send your name, email address, and company name to wfttstdr@adobe.com.

### Access Workfront Fusion for practice

Workfront does not offer Workfront Fusion test drives. To practice as you complete the learning paths, request access to Workfront Fusion from your organization’s Workfront Fusion administrator.

### Step-by-step instructions on completing the walkthrough exercises

There are step-by-step instructions on completing the walkthrough exercises. You can access these from the left navigation bar under Fusion > Exercises, or use the link provided at the bottom of a walkthrough tutorial.
