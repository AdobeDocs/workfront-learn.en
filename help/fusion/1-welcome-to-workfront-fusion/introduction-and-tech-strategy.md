# What is Adobe Workfront Fusion?

Workfront Fusion is a powerful integration platform that lets work flow freely across systems and teams. Its role is to automate your processes so that you can concentrate on new tasks rather than repeating the same tasks again and again. It works by linking actions within and between apps and services to create a scenario that transfers and transforms your data automatically.
