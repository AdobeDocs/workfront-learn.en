# Core concepts

In this video, you will learn:

* Three core concepts that make up Workfront Fusion: scenarios, apps, and modules

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/335260/?quality=12&learn=on)

## Core concepts terminology

**Scenario**—A scenario consists of a series of steps (modules) that indicate how data should be transferred and transformed between apps/services.

**App**—An app most commonly represents a connector to a software application but can also represent special functions that manipulate data.

**Module**—A single step within a scenario that performs some function based upon the associated app.

## Does Workfront Fusion have pre-built connectors to…?

Many Workfront Fusion users reach a point where they're thinking about all the systems they use and eventually ask, "Does Workfront Fusion have connectors to ____ software?" (Fill in the blank for the systems that you use.) 

The simplest way to determine if Workfront Fusion has a pre-built connector is to use the Add app feature and search for an app by name. You can also check the [Apps and their modules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront/using/adobe-workfront-fusion/fusion-apps-and-modules/apps-and-their-modules.html?lang=en) article on Experience League for a list of applications Workfront Fusion can connect with.

Connectors aren't limited only to the apps in this article. If the app you want to work with doesn't have a pre-built connector, you can use these modules to connect directly to the web service:

* HTTP modules
* SOAP module
* JSON modules

Don't worry about digging too deep into those modules just yet—training is available in other Workfront Fusion tutorials. Even though there is a little more coding involved with these modules than with a pre-built connector, the hardest part of authenticating to your other systems is easily handled with these modules.
