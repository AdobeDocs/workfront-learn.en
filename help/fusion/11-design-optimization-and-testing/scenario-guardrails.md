# Scenario guardrails

Work automation requires rapid processing, so Workfront Fusion is designed for high performance. Because long-running scenarios can slow down the pace of your work, Workfront Fusion was designed with performance-preserving guardrails that limit execution time, data size, and other scenario parameters. Workfront Fusion scenario designers should be aware of these guardrails and incorporate them into their design practices.

In this video, you will learn about:

* Scenario guardrails
* Module guardrails
* File guardrails
* Webhook guardrails
