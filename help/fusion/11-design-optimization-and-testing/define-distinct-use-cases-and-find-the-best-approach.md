# Define distinct use cases and find the best approach

When thinking through an automation before you build, there are strategies you can deploy to minimize the rework required or number of iterations you must go through.

You'll save the most time by defining a clear use case triggered by a specific event. When you don't take time early on to make sure you're headed in the right direction, you'll end up with complex or inefficient scenarios.

In this video, you will learn how to:

* Identify a specific use case for your scenario
* Choose the right trigger module
* Determine the right design for high performance
* Challenge assumptions and give stakeholders the best advice
