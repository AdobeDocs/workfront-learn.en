# Testing and launch

Workfront Fusion testing should focus on checking input and output data between the connected software platforms and the data transformations performed within a Workfront Fusion scenario. In addition, Workfront Fusion integration testing is conducted to evaluate the compliance of your scenario to meet specific business requirements. Essentially, we do Workfront Fusion testing to make sure that the integration works as expected.

## Testing considerations

In this video, you will learn how to:

* Consistently consider testing
* Include source and destination systems
* Iterate through design and testing
* Create detailed and shareable documentation
* Test depth, breadth, complexity, and load

## Testing considerations checklist

Your goal in testing is to make sure requirements are followed, that there is no scope creep, and to catch anything any Workfront Fusion user might accidentally do to break things.

Keep these guidelines in mind to ensure your testing is consistent and captures all essential elements.

* Determine what test data is needed based on requirements. Typically the most effective testing is based on well-defined and documented requirements. 
* Plan and communicate how to generate data needed to test depth, breadth, complexity, and load. Avoid “happy path” only testing. Think of all the ways users may interact with the automations and the wide range of possible data that will be processed. 
* Consider needed input and output data between connected systems. Verify input and output in those systems, not just in Workfront Fusion.

Prioritize testing throughout the entire lifecycle of your Workfront Fusion implementation. When designing, think about how you can test whether the design decisions meet requirements. Think through how unexpected data could result in errors and add relevant error handling as you build. Plan to iterate through workable prototypes as you continually test.
