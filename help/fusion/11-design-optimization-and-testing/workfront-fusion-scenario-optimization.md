# Workfront Fusion scenario optimization

What is “scenario optimization” and what can you do to optimize your scenarios?

Scenario optimization is a practiced skill that takes time and dedication to develop. Your first attempt at building a scenario for a business outcome should not be your last. Scenarios should be iterated upon from day one until your integration is launched. Even after you launch, scenarios should be reviewed and updated throughout their lifespan to keep up with business and behavior changes.

Scenarios require maintenance. Workfront Fusion developers should have a regular cadence of reviewing scenarios for opportunities to rebuild, restructure, or optimize. Workfront Fusion scenarios need regular attention, upkeep, and maintenance.

In this video, you will learn how to:

* Perform fewer operations
* Send fewer API calls
* Use fewer modules
