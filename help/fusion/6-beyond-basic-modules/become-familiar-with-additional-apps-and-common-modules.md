# Become familiar with additional apps and common modules

## Reminder on module types

### Trigger modules

Can only be used as the first module and can return zero, one, or more bundles which will be processed individually in subsequent modules, unless aggregated.  

* **Instant Trigger** (Lightning Bolt on Trigger)—Immediately triggered based upon webhook.
* **Scheduled Trigger** (Clock on Trigger)—Special capabilities to keep track of the last record processed.

### Actions and search modules

* **Action** — Used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations.
* **Searches** — Used to search for zero, one, or more records and returns these as bundles which will be processed individually in subsequent modules, unless aggregated.
