# Multiple billing rates

Within [!DNL Workfront], a project manager has the ability to override system billing rates within a specific project. Previously, when the new billing rate was applied to the project, it not only affected future hours but hours already logged on the project.

With [!DNL Workfront]’s new multiple billing rate capability, the project manager is able to decide what period of time a billing rate should be applied. This way, if a rate has been negotiated or changed, the project manager can determine when that rate should take effect.

## Change the billing rate

1. Go to the project’s landing page. Select **[!UICONTROL Billing Rates]** from the left panel.

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Billing Rates]** tab, click the **[!UICONTROL Add Billing Rate]** button. Select **[!UICONTROL New Billing Rate]** from the dropdown.

1. The [!UICONTROL New Billing Rate] dialogue box appears. From the **[!UICONTROL Job Role]** dropdown, select the job role to which the new billing rate will be applied.

1. Once the job role is selected, the [!UICONTROL Default Billing Rate] and the [!UICONTROL Billing Rate 1] field appear. Enter the new billing rate in the [!UICONTROL Billing Rate 1] field. If that billing rate applies to the whole project (past, present, and future hours logged), click the **[!UICONTROL Save]** button.

1. If the new billing rate only applies for a certain period of time, click the **[!UICONTROL Add Rate]** button. The [!UICONTROL Billing Rate 1 End Date] and the [!UICONTROL Billing Rate 2] fields appear. Enter the End Date for [!UICONTROL Billing Rate 1]. You cannot enter a Start Date for [!UICONTROL Billing Rate 1] because the system assumes it started at the beginning of the project.

1. If this is not the case:

   * Enter the default billing rate for [!UICONTROL Billing Rate 1].
   * Select the End Date for [!UICONTROL Billing Rate 1] ([!UICONTROL Default Billing Rate]).
   * The Start Date for [!UICONTROL Billing Rate 2] will automatically be set to the day after [!UICONTROL Billing Rate 1] ends.
   * Enter the desired billing rate in the [!UICONTROL Billing Rate 2] section.
   * Continue to add billing rates, as needed, by clicking the **[!UICONTROL Add Rate]** button.
   * When done, click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
   * All Billing Rates will show in the [!UICONTROL Billing Rates] tab on the project.
