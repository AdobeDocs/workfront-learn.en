# Set up exchange rates

[!DNL Workfront] supports different currencies for customer organizations that are multinational companies. Exchange rates can be used on projects and reports to reflect financial information in different currencies from around the world.

Exchange rates are managed by system administrators. Additional currencies can be set up as needed for your organization.

[!DNL Workfront]’s base (default) currency is the United States dollar. This is the currency that financial information will be calculated in by default, unless a different currency is specified on an individual project.
