# Set up exchange types

Expenses in [!DNL Workfront] represent non-labor costs associated with projects and other work.

These expenses should be logged within the project so planned costs and actual costs can be calculated and reported on for any project.

[!DNL Workfront] has pre-built expense types that can be used when entering expenses. The defaults cannot be deleted or modified, but new ones can be added.
