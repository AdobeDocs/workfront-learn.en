# Get started with [!UICONTROL Enhanced Analytics]

## Analytics prerequisites

To get the most out of Workfront’s Enhanced analytics, you need to make sure that your teams are entering data and updating certain fields as accurately as possible.

When we use the term “team” in Analytics, we’re referring to “home teams.” Workfront users can be on multiple teams, but they can only be on one home team. The teams used in the People charts are made up of only users who have that team designated as their home team. 

Start things off right by making sure any project templates have accurate planned hours and durations assigned to all of the tasks.

When building the reports and charts, analytics uses the following information. Some of this information is filled in automatically by Workfront but some needs to be filled in by your users.

* Task Planned Hours (This is the most important field for Analytics. If your teams don't use planned hours, you can look at select charts based on project duration.)
* Project Name
* Project Condition
* Project Status
* Project Planned Start Date
* Planned Completion Date (for tasks and projects)
* Project Actual Start Date
* Project Actual End Date
* Project Duration
* Task Duration
* Task Status (Includes marking tasks as complete.)
* Task Name
* Task Percent Complete
* Task Planned Start Date
* Task Planned Completion Date
