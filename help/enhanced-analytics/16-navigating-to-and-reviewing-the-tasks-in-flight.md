## Task-level data

The Tasks in flight chart allows you to drill into a specific project's tasks to see the amount of work completed for each active task and how on schedule the tasks are. The chart allows you to understand what tasks in a project need to be completed and what the percentage of completion is for these tasks.

This information can help you determine:

* What people are working on.
* Which tasks could be putting a project at risk.
* How close a task is to completion.
* Who you need to talk to about a specific task.
