* How to set up resource managers with the right access

## Workload Balancer and utilization report

Along with the Resource Planner and Resource Pools, users have access to additional tools such as the Workload Balancer and the utilization report when given the Edit permission in the access level.

No other setting is necessary to access or manage resources through these tools.
