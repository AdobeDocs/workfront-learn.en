# Review work in [!DNL My Updates] or [!DNL Workfront Home]

Adobe Workfront provides two places to access work assigned to you for review and approval: 

* [!DNL My Updates] 
* [!DNL Workfront Home] 

The [!DNL My Updates] page keeps things simple by showing any approval requests assigned to you, plus updates you’re included on. This page loads by default for Review license users when you log into Workfront, unless your organization’s system administrator has set a different landing page.

[!DNL Workfront Home] can be used for more than just approvals. If you have a Work or Plan license in Workfront, your assignments from projects and requests are found in Home. Home may be the page you land on when you log in to Workfront, or alternatively, you may need to select Home from the Main Menu, depending on your organization’s Workfront system configurations.

Which section you use to manage your approval requests depends on your organization’s processes for reviewing and approving work. Check with your manager, system administrator, or internal Workfront team to determine which you should be using to best support your workflow.
