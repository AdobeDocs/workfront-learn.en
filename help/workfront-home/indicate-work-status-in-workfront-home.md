# Change the status of work assignments in [!DNL Workfront] [!UICONTROL Home]

In this video, you will learn:

* The purpose of status in [!DNL  Workfront]
* How to change the status of work assignments

## Start vs. Work On It

As you’re reviewing your work assignments in [!UICONTROL Home], you may notice a button that says [!UICONTROL Start Task] or [!UICONTROL Start Issue].

When you click [!UICONTROL Start Task], this automatically changes the status of your task to In Progress (or a status that’s the equivalent at your organization).

Some teams may see a [!UICONTROL Work On It] button instead. In that case, you’re stating you accept the assignment but haven’t started working on the item just yet. The status of the task doesn’t change.

The name and functionality of the button is determined by your system or group administrator and on your organization's workflows and processes.
