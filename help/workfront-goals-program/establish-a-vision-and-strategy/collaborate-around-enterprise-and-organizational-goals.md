* As leaders and work managers seek to understand and segment the top-levels goals, consider the question: What must you and/or your teams achieve to drive the accomplishment of this top-level goal?
* Cascaded goals should represent a necessary outcome that must be achieved to drive or enable the achievement of its parent.
* Don’t create complex goal hierarchies that are difficult to follow or have too many layers. A good rule of thumb is to keep your goal hierarchy related to the scope of the goal setters, and only build a hierarchy to the depth you’re willing and able to manage.
