# Communication and goal health in [!DNL Workfront Goals]

Now that you've updated your goals using [!UICONTROL Check-ins], take a moment to step back and get a bird's-eye view of the goals you're working on and how they relate to the team, group, and company goals. Communicating with others on the progress and status of your goals is an important part of staying aligned.

There are various ways to keep the right people updated on your goals. You can start by: 

* Sharing and reporting on your goals
* Setting up your view of the [!UICONTROL Pulse] stream to create and view individual goal updates
* Leveraging the [!UICONTROL Graphs] section to get a comprehensive snapshot of your goals' progress

## Share a goal

You can share a goal you created or a goal created by someone else to which you have permissions to manage. You cannot share goals with groups, teams, or companies. If you have Manage permissions to a goal, you can change goal’s permissions for the goal creator. By default, the person creating the goal has Manage permissions, but you can change them to View. 

1. Click the name of the goal to share from any section in the [!DNL Goals] area to open the [!UICONTROL Goal Details] panel.

1. Click the 3-dot icon next to the goal name, then click [!UICONTROL **Share**]. The [!UICONTROL Goal Access] box displays.

1. Do one of the following:

   * Select the [!UICONTROL Manage system-wide] setting to give Manage permissions to everyone in the system who has Edit access to [!DNL Goals] through their [!DNL Workfront] access level. This is deselected by default for all new goals.
   * Start typing the name of a user that you want to give [!UICONTROL Manage] permissions to in the [!UICONTROL Give Manage access to] box. Select the name when it appears in the list.

1. Click [!UICONTROL **Share**]. A "System-wide" label or the names of the users who have Manage permissions to the goal display in the [!UICONTROL Access to Manage] field in the [!UICONTROL Goal Details] panel.

## Report on goal information

You can build Goal reports or Project reports that include information about associated goals in [!DNL Workfront]. There are several ways to view goal information in reports.

* Create a Goal report in the Reports area. You can display various information about the goal on the Goal report (for example: name, owner, dates, progress, etc.), which includes the following:
    
  * **Goal Hierarchy**—Displays all parent goals and how they connect to each other.
  * **Is Company Goal**—Indicates whether your organization is designated as the owner of a goal.
  * **Owner Type**— Indicates whether the owner of a goal is a user, team, or group.

* Create a project report that displays goal information, including the following:
  * **Goal Hierarchy**—Displays all parent goals and how they connect to each other.
  * **Goals**—This is a collection field that displays all goals associated with a project.
  * **Number of linked goals**—The number of goals associated with the project.
